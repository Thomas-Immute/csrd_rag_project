ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Introduction
EFRAG has started the collection of questions related to ESRS through the EFRAG ESRS Q&A
Platform on 24 October 2023. EFRAG releases explanations following due process on a regular
basis. Explanations are non-authoritative in nature, answer technical questions on ESRS by
showing where in the standards the content is provided and how to navigate them accordingly.
EFRAG has, since October 2023, released the following batches of explanations (number of
explanations):
February 2024 12
March 2024 12
May 2024 44
July 2024 25
November 2024 64
Total 157
The next major update of the Compilation of Explanations is expected to be released in Spring
2025. This document contains all 157 explanations on a consolidated basis. The questions are
identified by a progressive identification number (ID) that they received when submitted to the
Q&A Platform.
To inform when an explanation has been included in this document a release date is provided for
each explanation. Furthermore, Appendix I: Table of ID release date shows when an explanation
has been released.
Acknowledging that undertakings may need sufficient time to consider the content of an issued
Explanation, nevertheless they would be expected to consider them on a timely basis.
Explanations are grouped by topical area:
(a) ESRS General Requirements and General Disclosures;
(b) Environmental ESRS;
(c) Social ESRS;
(d) Governance ESRS; and
(e) XBRL and datapoints.
To order the explanations in a systematic manner and to increase usability for those looking for
an explanation, they were allocated to ESRS Disclosure Requirements respectively in the case of
ESRS 1 to its chapters.
A key word index in Appendix II supports the search of questions.
The Compilation of Explanations has in Appendix III a log of now 133 questions received that were
categorised as ‘already asked’ including a reference to where they have been already answered.
For convenience purposes hyperlinks have been added:
(a) to the official text of the respective ESRS including the corrigendum published on 18 April
2024 after each ESRS heading in this document (ESRS including Corrigendum);
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 9 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(b) to IG 1 Materiality Assessment at the beginning of ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as
the basis for sustainability disclosures section and IG 2: Value Chain at the beginning of
ESRS 1 chapter 5 Value chain section;
(c) to Question ID 177 - Mapping sustainability matters as listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16
with Disclosure Requirements, which due to its importance and volume has been
published in a separate document; and
(d) within the explanations to cross-referenced to other explanations mentioned when
answering the question.

ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraphs 18, 77 and 80; ESRS 1 Chapters 1 to 3.5; ESRS 2 paragraph 62 and 72
Key terms
Voluntary disclosure requirements (‘may disclose’)
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 18 states: ‘ESRS uses the following terms to distinguish between different
degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose information:
(a) “shall disclose” – indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement
or datapoint; and
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 11 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(b) “may disclose” – indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 79 of Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-12 is a ‘shall’ disclosure and states: ‘The
undertaking shall disclose the percentage of persons with disabilities amongst its employees
subject to legal restrictions on the collection of data.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 80 of Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-12 is voluntary and states: ‘The
undertaking may disclose the percentage of employees with disabilities with a breakdown by
gender.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities.’
In ESRS E1 paragraph AR 32, instead of ‘may disclose’ the expression ‘can disclose’ is used as a
synonym; see, e.g. the statement ‘When preparing the information on energy consumption
required under paragraph 35 … The undertaking that consumes fuel as feedstocks can disclose
information on this consumption separately from the required disclosures’.
Answer
(1) What is the meaning of ‘may disclose’ in ESRS? How does that relate to ‘shall
disclose’?
(4) Is an undertaking required to disclose a datapoint that is not material if it is a ‘shall
disclose’ datapoint?
The drafting convention used in the ESRS is defined in ESRS 1 Chapter 1.3. The terms ‘shall
disclose’ and ‘may disclose’ are used to distinguish the degree of obligation on the undertaking
to disclose information; these are defined in ESRS 1 paragraph 18. The terms ‘shall disclose’ and
‘may disclose’ are to be applied in light of the materiality provisions of ESRS (refer to ESRS 1
Chapter 3.2 to 3.5).
(a) All the ‘shall’ datapoints in ESRS 2 General Disclosures are to be reported as they are
outside the materiality assessment. This includes the datapoints in topical standards that
relate to ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 Description of the process to identify and
assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2 Appendix C: Disclosure and
Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General
Disclosures).
(b) If a topic is not material for the undertaking, the ‘may’ and ‘shall’ datapoints in the
corresponding topical standard are not to be reported as the undertaking does not report
on non-material topics.
(c) If a topic is material for the undertaking, the ‘shall’ datapoints in the respective topical
standard that relate to ESRS 2 (refer to Appendix C of ESRS 2 for the complete list by
topical standard) must be reported.
(d) If a topic is material for the undertaking, the undertaking discloses the information
corresponding to the ‘shall’ datapoints in the topical standard in relation to policies,
actions and targets (PAT) as well as the information corresponding to the datapoints in
ESRS 2 MDR-P, MDR-A and MDR-T. If the undertaking cannot disclose the information on
PAT required under relevant topical ESRS because such PAT are not in place for the
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 12 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
specific material matter, it shall disclose this to be the case and provide reasons for not
having PAT. The undertaking may disclose a timeframe in which it aims to adopt them.
(e) If a topic is material for the undertaking, the undertaking discloses the information
corresponding to the ‘shall’ datapoints in the topical standard in relation to metrics if that
information is assessed to be material (refer to ESRS 1 paragraph 34), i.e. the undertaking
is not required to disclose a ‘shall disclose’ datapoint that is not material.
(f) If a topic (or a matter) is material for the undertaking, the undertaking decides whether
or not to include the ‘may’ disclosure datapoints related to that matter; however, it is
encouraged to disclose it as good practice, but it is not a requirement.
The criteria in paragraph 31 of ESRS 1 (significance of the information and users’ needs) are the
point of reference to be used when:
(a) defining the granularity of the content of the information provided under points (a), (c)
and (d) above; and
(b) assessing the materiality of the information under point (e) above.
(2) Can you explain this based on ESRS Disclosure Requirement S1-12?
Assuming that the sub-subtopic ‘employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities’ is
assessed to be material, the undertaking must disclose the metric ‘percentage of persons with
disabilities amongst its employees subject to legal restrictions on the collection of data’ (ESRS S1
paragraph 79). While this is not a requirement, it may provide a breakdown by gender as an
optional good practice (ESRS S1 paragraph 80).
(3) Does the materiality assessment take precedence over ESRS 1 paragraph 18?
No, for optional disclosures the materiality assessment does not take precedence over ESRS 1
paragraph 18. This means that for a topic that is assessed as material (see previous example on
S1-12) it is optional, but the undertaking is encouraged to disclose a ‘may’ datapoint also if the
information pertaining to the datapoint in question is material.
See also the paragraph that is in the answer to question (1) above.
(5) Can an undertaking disregard the disclosure of a ‘may disclose’ datapoint if the
datapoint is material?
Yes, see example on ESRS S1-12. This is due to the nature of the ‘may’ datapoint (a voluntary
datapoint to encourage good practice).
(6) What is the relevance of ESRS 1 paragraph 18 if materiality takes precedence over
ESRS 1 paragraph 18?
ESRS 1 paragraph 18 illustrates the nature or drafting convention used for the datapoints, and it
has to be applied in conjunction with the materiality considerations – i.e. the ‘shall’ datapoints
are still subject to materiality assessment.
Question ID 106 - Entity-specific guidance and examples
Release date
February 2024
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 13 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Question asked
What are concrete examples of potential entity-specific sustainability matters and any guidance
related to finding and dealing with such?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapter 10.1 and paragraphs 10, AR 4 and AR 5
Key terms
Entity-specific disclosures
Background
ESRS 1 chapter 10.1 ‘Transitional provision related to entity-specific disclosures’ states in its
paragraphs the following:
‘130. The extent to which sustainability matters are covered by ESRS is expected to evolve as
further Disclosure Requirements are developed. Therefore, the need for entity-specific
disclosures is likely to decrease over time, in particular as a result of the future adoption of sector
specific standards.
131. When defining its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking may adopt transitional
measures for their preparation in the first three annual sustainability statements under which it
may as a priority:
(a) introduce in its reporting those entity-specific disclosures that it reported in prior periods, if
these disclosures meet or are adapted to meet the qualitative characteristics of information
referred to under chapter 2 of this Standard; and
(b) complement its disclosures prepared on the basis of the topical ESRS with an appropriate set
of additional disclosures to cover sustainability matters that are material for the undertaking
in its sector(s), using available best practice and/or available frameworks or reporting
standards, such as IFRS industry-based guidance and GRI Sector Standards.’
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 4 and 5 state:
‘AR 4. When developing its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall carefully consider:
comparability between undertakings, while still ensuring relevance of the information provided,
recognising that comparability may be limited for entity-specific disclosures. The undertaking shall
consider whether the available and relevant frameworks, initiatives, reporting standards and
benchmarks (such as technical material issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board
or the Global Reporting Initiative) provide elements that can support comparability to the
maximum extent possible.
AR 5. Further guidance for developing entity-specific disclosures can be found by considering the
information required under topical ESRS that addresses similar sustainability matters.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 14 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
At this stage, it is not possible to provide concrete examples as this will depends on facts and
circumstances of the reporting undertaking, including the sector(s) it is operating in. Sector-
specific sustainability matters will be addressed in the future sector standards still to be finalized.
When developing entity-specific disclosures (ESRS 1, paragraph 11), ESRS 1 points to ‘available
and relevant frameworks, initiatives, standards, benchmarks’. Two examples are provided as
possible sources of relevant entity-specific disclosures (see ESRS 1 paragraph 131 (b)): the IFRS
industry-based guidance and the GRI Sector Standards.
The IFRS industry-based guidance is the former SASB standards; they can be found here:
https://sasb.org/standards/download/ and GRI Sector Standards can be downloaded from
https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/sector-program/
These two sources offer examples of sector-specific information that could complement on an
entity-specific basis the information required in sector-agnostic ESRS depending on the relevant
sector.
In general, there are two types of instances that will give rise to entity-specific information:
(a) when the undertaking identifies a material matter that is not covered by Disclosure
Requirements in ESRS; and
(b) when, for a matter that is covered by Disclosure Requirements in ESRS, the undertaking
concludes that in order to provide information that meets the qualitative characteristics
of the information (Appendix B of ESRS 1) additional disclosures need to be included. This
may be the case for a specific aspect of a sub-subtopic (see AR 16 of ESRS 1) when such a
sub-subtopic is covered in ESRS but the specific aspects (i.e., an additional level of
granularity) is not covered. This may also be the case for a specific metric that is not
included in ESRS, but considering the specific facts and circumstances of the undertaking,
this metric is necessary in order to provide the appropriate quality of information.
The entity-specific information may relate to the description of a material impact, risk or
opportunity (along the lines of ESRS 2 SBM 3), it may relate to policies, actions and targets that
the undertaking has set, or it may relate to metrics.
Question ID 109 - Bold text and ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6
Release date
February 2024
Question asked
Is the ‘bolded paragraph’ following each ESRS Disclosure Requirement a disclosure that the
undertaking has to respond to? Or is it simply a ‘headline’ that prescribes what the paragraph will
contain once all the individual datapoints are completed? See also ESRS E1 Disclosure
Requirement E1-6.
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 and all topical ESRS, especially ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 15 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
‘Bolded paragraph’; ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6
Background
In ESRS 2 and in the topical ESRS, Disclosure Requirements are generally followed by a ‘bold
paragraph’ stating ‘The undertaking shall disclose . . .’ with a general statement of the information
that needs to be disclosed under the respective Disclosure Requirement.
The ‘bold paragraph’ is followed by an objective paragraph, which is followed by more detailed
paragraphs containing the datapoints that must be disclosed under the respective Disclosure
Requirement and further specifications of the information being requested.
In the case of ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6, this is as follows:
ESRS E1 paragraph 44 provides a ‘bold paragraph’ with the general statement of the requirement
that needs to be satisfied under ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6.;
ESRS E1 paragraph 45 outlines the objective of the disclosure requirement; and
ESRS E1 paragraphs 46-52 further specify information to be included when disclosing on ESRS E1
paragraph 44.
This is illustrated as follows:

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 17 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
The ‘bold paragraph’ that introduces each Disclosure Requirement is not simply a headline. It is a
general statement of what needs to be disclosed under the respective Disclosure Requirement.
The information provided under a Disclosure Requirement should satisfy the overall objective of
it, as stated in the paragraph following the bold paragraph (‘the objective of this Disclosure
Requirement is . . .’).
The subsequent paragraphs include a list of datapoints (‘the disclosure provided under paragraph
XXX shall include . . .’). This list is generally sufficient to meet the disclosure requirements;
however, such a list cannot be assumed to be exhaustive, as meeting the disclosure requirement
takes precedent over the list of datapoints.
In providing the disclosure that corresponds to the list of individual datapoints (if applicable per
the related Application Requirements), it is assumed that both the following are met:
(c)requirements of the ‘bold paragraph’; and
(d) objective as stated in the subsequent paragraph.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 18 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
The ‘bold paragraph’ of ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6 (i.e., ESRS E1 paragraph 44) covers
Scope 1, 2 and 3 and total GHG emissions. The objective of the Disclosure Requirements also
covers Scope 1, 2 and 3 and total GHG emissions. ESRS E1 paragraph 52 mentions the total GHG
emissions. The total GHG emissions shall be reported as it is included in both the bold paragraph
and the objective.
Question ID 157 - ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement GOV, and
specification in the topical ESRS
Release date
February 2024
Question asked
When a topical standard does not include Disclosure Requirements that are applicable jointly with
ESRS 2 (ref. to Appendix C of ESRS 2), are ESRS 2 requirements applicable in relation to that topic?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraphs 9 and 29; ESRS 2 GOV 1 to 5; ESRS E1 paragraph 13
Key terms
ESRS 2 related disclosures in topical standards
Background
The original question received was reworded to the above question; the original question was: ‘If
there is no additional guidance, then do the other disclosure requirements do not apply to the
topical standard (meaning GOV 1 and GOV 2 do not apply)? Or do they all still apply, but there is
just more guidance to follow (such that there is more specific guidance for GOV 3 specifically when
reporting on E1)?’
In the architecture of the ESRS, the two cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 General Requirements and
ESRS 2 General Disclosures are complemented by ten topical standards (E, S and G). ESRS 1
paragraph 9 states: ‘Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general
level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements
in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures provides a list of the
additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the
general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.’
ESRS 2 disclosure requirements are ‘cross-cutting in nature’, so they do not refer to a specific topic,
but some of them also have topical specifications in the topical standards as explained in ESRS 2
Appendix C. An example is ESRS 2 GOV-3 ‘Integration of sustainability-related performance in
incentive schemes’: this disclosure requirement (paragraphs 27-29) has a specification in the
climate topical standard ESRS E1 paragraph 13.
ESRS E1 paragraph 13: ‘The undertaking shall disclose whether and how climate-related
considerations are factored into the remuneration of members of the administrative,
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 19 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
management and supervisory bodies , including if their performance has been assessed against
the GHG emission reduction targets reported under Disclosure Requirement E1-4 and the
percentage of the remuneration recognised in the current period that is linked to climate related
considerations, with an explanation of what the climate considerations are.’
A basic principle is that the requirements in the topical standards should be read and applied in
conjunction with the cross-cutting standards.
Furthermore, all topical standards are subject to materiality assessment.
Answer
Disclosure Requirements (DRs), including their datapoints, in the cross-cutting standard ESRS 2
General Disclosures are to be reported irrespective of the outcome of the materiality assessment
(for example, GOV-1, GOV-2, GOV-3, GOV-4, and GOV-5), see ESRS 1 paragraph 29. The content of
ESRS 2 (with the exception of MDR – P, A, T) is not intended to provide a content to be followed
in each and every topic, but it provides content that is to be provided at corporate/general level
(across all the topics).
All topical standards should be read in conjunction with the cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 and
ESRS 2, as these apply to the sustainability statement as a whole.
There are datapoints related to the ESRS 2 DRs in some of the topical standards. These are outlined
in the table in ESRS 2 Appendix C, Disclosure and Application Requirements in topical ESRS that
are applicable in conjunction with ESRS 2 General disclosures. They include GOV-1 in ESRS G1
‘Business conduct’, paragraph 5, and GOV-3 in ESRS E1 ‘Climate change’, paragraph 13.
The topical specifications of ESRS 2 DRs listed in Appendix C of ESRS 2 provide additional
datapoints that shall be included and/or additional considerations that the undertaking has to
take into account when preparing the respective ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirements.
In terms of the scope of the materiality assessment:
(e) ESRS 1 paragraph 29 specifies the Disclosure Requirements always to be included
irrespective of the outcome of materiality. These include the ESRS 2 IRO-1 requirements
(listed in Appendix C of ESRS 2) that are located in the topical standards, which are to be
applied also if the respective topic is not material.
(f) Other ESRS 2 specifications (listed in Appendix C of ESRS 2) and the other disclosure
requirements located in topical standards are subject to materiality assessment. This
implies that the undertaking only has to report on them when the respective topic is
considered material. This avoids having to report, for example, on GOV-1 ‘Business
conduct’ (topical standard) if the topic ‘Business conduct’ has been determined not to be
material to the undertaking.
(g) All narrative disclosures including those in ESRS 2 should be applied with consideration
to paragraph 31 of ESRS 1, which sets the criteria for assessing the materiality of
information to be provided and ultimately affect the granularity of the reported
information.
When a Disclosure Requirement in ESRS 2 does not have topical specifications, ESRS 2 has to be
applied as specified in ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement. No additional datapoints to those in ESRS
2 or considerations at topical level apply in these cases. If ESRS 2 does not set topical specifications
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 20 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
for a given topic, ESRS SBM-3 requires nevertheless to disclose material impacts, risks and
opportunities for that material topic.
Question ID 429 – Entity-specific and ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirements
Release date
July 2024
Question asked
When addressing the required entity-specific disclosure, which are the datapoints or the
Disclosure Requirements to consider from ESRS 2?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraphs 11, 30, 60 and 70
Key terms
Entity-specific disclosures
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.’
In particular, ESRS paragraph AR 2 states: ‘When developing entity-specific disclosures, the
undertaking shall ensure that … (b) its disclosures include, where applicable, all material
information related to the reporting areas of governance; strategy; impact, risk and opportunity
management; and metrics and targets (see ESRS 2 chapters 2 to 5).’
ESRS 1 paragraph 30 states: ‘When the undertaking concludes that a sustainability matter is
material as a result of its materiality assessment on which ESRS 2 IRO-1, IRO-2 and SBM-3 set
disclosure requirements, it shall:
(a) disclose information according to the Disclosure Requirements (including Application
Requirements) related to that specific sustainability matter in the corresponding topical
and sector-specific ESRS; and
(b) disclose additional entity-specific disclosures (see paragraph 11 and AR 1 to AR 5 of this
Standard) when the material sustainability matter is not covered by an ESRS or is covered
with insufficient granularity.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 12 states the following regarding ‘Reporting areas and minimum content
disclosure requirements on policies, actions, targets and metrics’: ‘The Disclosure Requirements
in ESRS 2 in topical ESRS and in sector-specific ESRS are structured into the following reporting
areas:
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 21 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(a) Governance (GOV): the governance processes controls and procedures used to monitor,
manage and oversee impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2 Chapter 2 Governance);
(b) Strategy (SBM): how the undertaking’s strategy and business model interact with its
material impacts, risks and opportunities, including how the undertaking addresses those
impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2 Chapter 3 Strategy);
(c) Impact, risk and opportunity management (IRO): the process(es) by which the
undertaking:
a. identifies impacts, risks and opportunities and assesses their materiality (see
IRO-1 in Section 4.1 of ESRS 2);
b. manages material sustainability matters through policies and actions (see
Section 4.2 of ESRS 2);
(d) Metrics and targets (MT): the undertaking’s performance including targets it has set and
progress towards meeting them (see ESRS 2 Chapter 5 Metrics and targets).’
ESRS 2 paragraph 60 on minimum disclosure requirements on policies and actions states: ‘This
section sets out minimum disclosure requirements to be included when the undertaking discloses
information on its policies and actions to prevent, mitigate and remediate actual and potential
material impacts, to address material risks and/or to pursue material opportunities (collectively,
to “manage material sustainability matters”). They shall be applied together with the Disclosure
Requirements, including Application Requirements, provided in the relevant topical and sector-
specific ESRS. They shall also be applied when the undertaking prepares entity-specific
disclosures.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 70 on metrics and targets states: ‘This chapter sets out Minimum Disclosure
Requirements that shall be included when the undertaking discloses information on its metrics
and targets related to each material sustainability matter. They shall be applied together with the
Disclosure Requirements, including Application Requirements, provided in the relevant topical
ESRS. They shall also be applied when the undertaking prepares entity-specific disclosures.’
Answer
The datapoints or the Disclosure Requirements from ESRS 2 to consider, if applicable, when
addressing a required entity-specific disclosure are: ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement GOV-1 to
GOV-5, SBM-1 to SBM-3, IRO-1 and the Minimum Disclosure Requirements on policies and actions
on metrics and targets, respectively.
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 1 to 5 provides Application Requirements on entity-specific disclosures.
In situations where a sustainability matter is not covered by an ESRS, the entity-specific
disclosures to consider from ESRS 2 could potentially relate to any reporting area of ESRS 2 (for
the reporting areas of ESRS 2, see ESRS 1 paragraph 12), that is:
(a) governance;
(b) strategy;
(c) impact, risk and opportunity management; and
(d) metrics and targets.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 22 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
This is insofar as information regarding the entity-specific sustainability matter and its impact,
risk and opportunity is relevant (ESRS 1 paragraph 31) and it needs to be disclosed under the
ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirements.
Therefore, if applicable, impacts, risks and opportunities of the entity-specific matter could be
addressed by the following ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirements:
(a) GOV-1: regarding roles and responsibilities and access to expertise and skills with regard
to the entity-specific sustainability matter;
(b) GOV-2: regarding information related to the entity-specific sustainability matter provided
to and addressed by the undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory
bodies;
(c) GOV-3: regarding integration of the entity-specific sustainability matter in incentive
schemes;
(d) GOV-4: regarding entity-specific due diligence processes;
(e) GOV-5: regarding risk management and internal controls over the sustainability process,
including the entity-specific sustainability matter;
(f) SBM-1: regarding its strategy relating to the entity-specific sustainability matter;
(g) SBM-2: regarding interests and views of stakeholders with respect to the entity-specific
sustainability matter;
(h) SBM-3: regarding the description, the interaction with strategy and business model and
other information required by paragraph 48 of ESRS 2 on the material impacts, risks and
opportunities connected with the entity-specific matter (including ESRS 2 paragraph 48
(h)); and
(i) IRO-1: regarding a description of the process to identify and assess the entity-specific
material impacts, risk and opportunities.
In addition (following ESRS 1 paragraph AR 2):
(a) policies, actions and targets shall be included where applicable, i.e. when the undertaking
has them in place, to manage the relevant entity-specific matter/IRO; and
(b) metrics shall be included where applicable. In assessing when this is applicable, the
reference is ESRS 1 AR 1: the entity-specific disclosures shall enable users to understand
the undertaking’s material IROs. In general, to provide a relevant and fair representation
of an impact, risk or opportunity, metrics are useful and should be included.
ESRS paragraph AR 3 supports the determination of when entity-specific metrics are useful, i.e.:
(a) when they support the understanding of (1) how effective the practices are in reducing
negative impacts and increasing positive impacts and (2) how likely the financial effects
arising from risks and opportunities are;
(b) when they result in a reliable outcome (see ESRS 1 paragraph AR 3 (b)); and
(c) when they are accompanied by sufficient contextual information (see ESRS 1 paragraph
AR 3 (c)).

Question asked
Do entity-specific metrics need to be developed for a topic that is covered in the standards but is
only for a specific part of the value chain?
ESRS reference

Key terms
Entity-specific disclosure on matters not covered by ESRS Disclosure Requirements
Background
The submitter provided the following background for the question: ‘... for example, a company
has identified a matter as material for which the topic of water is relevant in the value chain. In
the ESRS E3 standard, the topic of water in the value chain is covered by datapoints in the areas
of Policies, Targets and Actions. However, the associated metric relates exclusively to the
company’s own business activities (ESRS E3 paragraph 28-29). Can it now be deduced from
paragraph 30 (b) in ESRS 1 that the company must develop an entity-specific metric for this matter
because there is insufficient “granularity” here, or has the EU deliberately limited the metric to
its own business activities so that no metric for water use in the value chain has to be explicitly
developed?’
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.’
ESRS 1 paragraphs AR 1 and AR 2 state: ‘AR 1. The entity-specific disclosures shall enable users to
understand the undertaking’s impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to environmental, social
or governance matters.
AR 2. When developing entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall ensure that:
(a) the disclosures meet the qualitative characteristics of information as set out in chapter
2 Qualitative characteristics of information; and
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 24 of 278

(b) its disclosures include where applicable all material information related to the reporting
areas of governance; strategy; impact, risk and opportunity management; and metrics
and targets (see ESRS 2 chapters 2 to 5).’
ESRS 1 paragraph 65 states: ‘The undertaking shall include material value chain information when
this is necessary to:
(a) allow users of sustainability statements to understand the undertaking’s material
impacts, risks and opportunities; and/or
(b) produce a set of information that meets the qualitative characteristics of information (see
Appendix B of this Standard).’
Answer
Entity-specific disclosure shall be provided in addition to the Disclosure Requirements laid down
in the three categories of ESRS (i.e., cross-cutting, topical and sector-specific standards) when an
undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with
sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and circumstances (ESRS
1 paragraph 11).
If an undertaking has concluded that a topic is material in its value chain, but the relevant topical
standard only requires to disclose metrics related to own operations, the provision of metrics that
cover specifically the value chain shall be considered and provided if such metrics are necessary
according to paragraph 11 of ESRS 1. Sector ESRS may introduce additional metrics, including on
the value chain.

Question asked
When calculating metrics for sustainability matters that are material for a group, do the data of
all subsidiaries have to be considered with the same level of accuracy even if the matter is not
material for some subsidiaries of the group?

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 25 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
The submitter provided the following background for his question: ‘The following example refers
to metrics in the context of water and marine resources. However, it should be noted that the
question raised similarly applies to all sustainability matters and metrics and that the subtopic
“water” was chosen for illustration purposes only.
Example: The main business of a group is manufacturing and selling a specific product, which is
produced in a water-intensive production process in various own facilities. The group further
owns and operates several sales corporations abroad, with a limited number of employees
working in offices not being involved in production-related activities. The group determines that
all topics and subtopics mentioned in ESRS E3 on water and marine resources are material and
concludes that all metrics governed by ESRS E3 need to be disclosed.
Furthermore, based on a preliminary estimate, the group notes that its production facilities will
bear the vast majority of the amounts of all metric data on this topic, whereas the sales
corporations would account for a marginal portion of those metrics, which consequently the
group considers not to be material. However, the group is aware of the requirement to calculate
the metrics based on own operations, i.e., including the parent company and all the subsidiaries
of the group. Therefore, it has established processes and procedures to measure directly and with
precision the part of the metrics attributable to the group’s production facilities, whereas it
continues to determine the part of the metrics attributable to its sales corporations based on
estimations such as average per capita figures. The total metrics disclosed is therefore the total
of the portion directly measured and a respective estimate.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 87 states: ’When quantitative metrics and monetary amounts including
upstream and downstream value chain information (see chapter 5 of this Standard) cannot be
measured directly and can only be estimated, measurement uncertainty may arise.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 89 states: ‘The use of reasonable assumptions and estimates including scenario
or sensitivity analysis is an essential part of preparing sustainability-related information and does
not undermine the usefulness of that information, provided that the assumptions and estimates
are accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not
necessarily prevent such an assumption or estimate from providing useful information or meeting
the qualitative characteristics of information (see Appendix B of this Standard).’
Answer
When providing metrics data, the undertaking is expected to comply with the text of ESRS by
providing the metric as defined in the Disclosure Requirement:
(a) data from all subsidiaries need to be included (unless the Disclosure Requirement of the
metric provides otherwise; see IG 1 Materiality assessment: FAQ 22 – Is a multi-sector
group required to include metrics for the entire group or only data related to the material
IRO?); and
(b) the use of estimates is subject to conditions (see ESRS 1 paragraphs 87 and 89), including
the need to consider the qualitative characteristics (ESRS 1 chapter 2).
In the example mentioned by the submitter, the undertaking will have to consider whether
precisely measuring the portion of the metrics attributable to the production facility – and using
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 26 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
an estimate for the portion attributable to the sales corporation – will result in a degree of
accuracy for the entire metric that is consistent with the characteristics of information quality.

Background
[The original question asked, ‘When calculating Indicators including Value Chain for the financial
sector (Capital markets, Insurance), do we have to consider downstream positions for all four
quarters (as of 31.03, 30.06, 30.09, 31.12)?’ was referring to metrics calculation in the financial
sector but, to be more general, the question was changed to the above.
As background to the question, the submitter provided the following: ‘Background is that SFDR
requires calculating PAIs for all relevant positions as per quarter end and then build an average.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 19 states: ‘When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall
apply:
(a) the fundamental qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. relevance and faithful
representation; and
(b) the enhancing qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. comparability,
verifiability and understandability.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 89 states: ‘The use of reasonable assumptions and estimates, including scenario
or sensitivity analysis, is an essential part of preparing sustainability-related information and does
not undermine the usefulness of that information, provided that the assumptions and estimates
are accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not

necessarily prevent such an assumption or estimate from providing useful information or meeting
the qualitative characteristics of information (see Appendix B of this Standard).’
Answer
ESRS do not require to calculate annual averages based on quarterly figures as required in
Article 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/363.
Some metrics require the calculation of annual averages (e.g. ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-
6 – Characteristics of the undertaking’s employees). ESRS do not prescribe how to calculate annual
averages as long as the calculation method results in information that meets the qualitative
characteristics of information (ESRS 1 Chapter 2; see also ESRS 1 paragraph 89).

Background
The question received by the submitter: ‘Can an impact be material if it is material from a positive
impact perspective only?’ was reworded to the above question to be clearer.
Background as provided by the submitter:
‘It is essential that when I have evaluated and qualitatively assessed the actual/potential negative
and positive effects on human beings and the environment, I have concluded that the topic is
irrelevant in terms of actual negative impacts and also irrelevant in terms of actual positive
impacts. However, it is critical from the perspective of potential positive impacts. Is my topic then
considered significant?’
ESRS 1 paragraph 43 states: ‘A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when
it pertains to the undertaking’s material actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on people
or the environment over the short-, medium- or long-term.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 46 states the criteria on which positive impacts materiality are based: ‘For
positive impacts, materiality is based on:
(a) the scale and scope of the impact for actual impacts; and
(b) the scale, scope and likelihood of the impact for potential impacts.’
Answer
Yes, a sustainability matter can be material from a positive impact perspective only.
Based on the definition in ESRS 1 paragraph 43, a sustainability matter is material when it
pertains:
(h) to material actual or potential impacts or
(i) to material positive or negative impacts.
Positive impacts can be either actual or potential.
ESRS 1 chapter 3.4 defines the criteria used to assess materiality. For actual positive impacts, the
criteria are scale and scope. In addition, for potential positive impacts likelihood is considered.
ESRS 1 paragraph 45 describes the relationship between negative impacts and the due diligence
process defined in international instruments (i.e., the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises). In particular, due diligence
focuses on negative or adverse impacts on people and the environment, but this does not mean
that impact materiality is limited to negative impacts under ESRS reporting.

Key terms
Minimum number of material sustainability matters
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 28 states: ‘A sustainability matter is “material” when it meets the criteria defined
for impact materiality . . . or financial materiality . . . or both.’
IG 1 Materiality assessment paragraph 1 states: ‘The ESRS sustainability statement shall include
relevant and faithful information about all impacts, risks and opportunities (also referred to as
IROs) across environmental, social and governance matters determined to be material from the
impact materiality perspective, the financial materiality perspective or both. The materiality
assessment is the process by which the undertaking determines material information on
sustainability IROs. This is achieved by the determination of material matters and material
information to be reported. The performance of a materiality assessment based on objective
criteria is pivotal to sustainability reporting. The undertaking will use judgement when applying
the criteria, and the related explanations are expected to provide transparency from the
undertaking to the users of the sustainability statement.’
The Application Requirements in Appendix A of ESRS include a list of sustainability matters
covered in ESRS.
Answer
There is no minimum (or maximum) number of material sustainability matters required by ESRS,
as materiality is based on the undertaking’s specific facts and circumstances.
Materiality is a principles-based concept. IG 1 Materiality assessment provides non-authoritative
guidance on how to conduct the materiality assessment. Materiality of a sustainability matter for
an undertaking depends on the specific facts and circumstances related to its strategy, business
model, own operations and value chain. Based on those specific facts and circumstances, a
number of material impacts, risks and opportunities will be identified as a result of the materiality
assessment.
Question ID 172 – Materiality assessment – private equity structures

Question asked
Which material sustainability matters must be identified and assessed in private equity structures
having general and limited partners?
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 30 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapters 5.1 Reporting undertaking and value chain and 7.6 Consolidated reporting and
subsidiary exemption
Key terms
Materiality assessment; private equity structures; general and limited partner
Background
Private equity (PE) structures usually have a general partner (GP) and limited partners (LPs). GP
refers to the PE firm that manages a private equity fund. These funds are usually set up as general
partnerships with the third-party investors being the limited partners and the PE firm acting as
the GP. In addition to raising the funds and administering the daily operations of the fund, the GP
is responsible for identifying and closing on investments in portfolio companies of the private
equity fund, assisting the portfolio company management teams in maximising value and
liquidating investments so distributions can be made from the partnership to the LPs. LPs are the
ones who have arranged and invested the capital for the private equity fund but who are not really
concerned about the daily maintenance of the fund, whereas GPs are investment professionals
who are vested with the responsibility of making decisions with respect to the investments.
To answer the question above, it is assumed that neither the GP nor the LPs consolidate the
portfolio company in their respective financial statements as neither of them financially control
the portfolio company.
ESRS 1 paragraph 62: ‘The sustainability statement shall be for the same reporting undertaking as
the financial statements.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 63: ‘The information about the reporting undertaking provided in the
sustainability statement shall be extended to include information on the material impacts, risks
and opportunities connected with the undertaking through its direct and indirect business
relationships in the upstream and/or downstream value chain (“value chain information”). …’
Answer
General and limited partners of private equity structures must identify and assess material
sustainability matters in their own operations and in their value chain.
If neither the general partner nor the limited partner/s consolidate the portfolio company/ies in
their respective financial statements because neither of them exercises financial control over the
portfolio company/ies, then impacts, risks and opportunities of the portfolio company/ies are not
part of the own operations of the general partner nor of the limited partner/s for the purposes
of the sustainability statement (See also Implementation Guidance EFRAG IG 2 Value Chain
chapter 2.3 From own operations to value chain).
The general partner typically provides management services to the portfolio company/ies
through the private equity fund. Therefore, in the absence also of financial control, the portfolio
company/ies are considered business relationships in the general partner’s value chain.
Accordingly, the general partner shall identify and assess material impacts, risks and
opportunities connected to the portfolio company in its downstream value chain.

equity, and debt instruments) considered business relationships that trigger value chain
information?

Key terms
Materiality assessment; stakeholder opinion; objective evidence
Background
To better address the issue mentioned by the submitter, it was agreed to change the question
that was received from ‘When evaluating sustainability matters, is the focus on stakeholder
opinions or on objective evidence?’ to the question above.
ESRS 1 paragraph 24 states: ‘Engagement with affected stakeholders is central to the
undertaking’s ongoing due diligence process … and sustainability materiality assessment.’
IG 1 Materiality assessment - FAQ 10 Should the assessment of IROs rely on quantitative
information? (paragraphs 180 to 183) states:
‘180. Where possible, yes, as quantitative measures of IROs are objective evidence of their
materiality. The emphasis on objective and quantitative information does not mean to
imply that the information from affected stakeholders should be disregarded.
181. The level of comfort sought by the undertaking from quantitative information depends on
whether there is scientific validated data and on consensus reached on the given impact.
For example, global reports or industry information on a given topic, such as negative
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 32 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
impacts on biodiversity loss, could provide the quantitative information needed without
the need for the undertaking to incur in additional research or data collection costs.
182. Quantitative information is not always available or may result in additional costs.
Whenever a qualitative analysis is sufficient for the undertaking to reasonably conclude
that a matter is “not material” or is “material”, additional quantitative information would
not add value to the materiality assessment. As the materiality assessment process evolves
over time, the undertaking may redefine the balance between qualitative or quantitative
information.
183. Quantitative information would, however, be of interest where a topic is on the edge of
being material/non-material based on qualitative information and/or where there are
diverse views. In that case, quantification could corroborate the conclusion.’
IG 1 Materiality assessment FAQ 15 Do the ESRS mandate to actively engage in dialogue with
affected stakeholders for the materiality assessment process? states: ‘The ESRS require disclosure
on the materiality assessment and its outcomes but do not mandate specific behaviour on
stakeholder engagement or the due diligence process.’
IG 1 Materiality assessment FAQ 16 Can the undertaking prioritise some categories of
stakeholders for the materiality assessment process? How? states: ‘Engagement with affected
stakeholders helps the undertaking to understand which sustainability matters are sources of
concern for the respective stakeholders and how they are affected. This information may be
useful input for the assessment.’
Answer
When assessing the materiality of a sustainability matter, there is no conflict between
consideration of views of affected stakeholders and objective evidence. The purpose of both is to
get an understanding of the severity (and likelihood) of impacts to present them faithfully in the
sustainability statement. Depending on the circumstances, this may or may not require
engagement with affected stakeholders.
The materiality analysis should be driven as much as possible by objective data and evidence.
Scientific evidence is the focus in some cases depending on the type of topic and availability of
such evidence. Quantitative/scientific data on the impact may or may not also be available.
Widespread/systemic impacts often tend to be well documented, and there is often a consensus
on their severity.
In other cases, depending on the topic the views of affected stakeholders are a source of
supporting evidence for impact materiality. However, not all stakeholder opinions are equally
relevant for the materiality analysis. Relevance depends on how much the stakeholders are
affected (severity – and likelihood – of impacts). Understanding entity-specific impacts and/or the
manifestation of widespread/systemic impacts in particular contexts and situations requires
more careful consideration of specific circumstances, including whether and how people or the
environment are affected.
Elements useful to address this question can be found in IG 1 Materiality assessment chapters 3.5

stakeholder engagement – impact materiality.

radioactive waste – can it be a non-material datapoint?
Release date
November 2024
Question asked
Is it necessary to report radioactive waste from analytical devices and tracer applications?
ESRS Reference
ESRS E5 paragraph 39; ESRS 1 paragraph 34, ESRS 2 paragraph 56
Key terms
Waste; radioactive waste; datapoint, non-material
Background
The submitter provided the following background: ‘Reporting all radioactive waste according to
2022/70/Euratom would include radioactive tracers and analytical devices and sensors. Reporting
of these wastes should be excluded because they are present in very small amounts and already
locally reported under applicable legislation. Outside the EU, the definition of radioactive waste
may also be different from 2022/70/Euratom.’
ESRS E5 paragraph 39 states: ‘The undertaking shall also disclose the total amount of hazardous
waste and radioactive waste generated by the undertaking, where radioactive waste is defined in
Article 3(7) of Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom as follows: “radioactive waste” means
radioactive material in gaseous, liquid or solid form for which no further use is foreseen or
considered by the Member State or by a legal or natural person whose decision is accepted by the
Member State, and which is regulated as radioactive waste by a competent regulatory authority
under the legislative and regulatory framework of the Member State’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability
matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking:
(a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such
information to be material; and
(a) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 56 states: ‘The undertaking shall also include a table of all the datapoints that
derive from other EU legislation as listed in Appendix B of this standard, indicating where they can
be found in the sustainability statement and including those that the undertaking has assessed as
not material, in which case the undertaking shall indicate “not material” in the table in accordance
with ESRS 1 paragraph 35.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 34 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
It depends on materiality whether it is necessary to report radioactive waste.
The Disclosure Requirement of ESRS E5-5 – Resource outflow with the datapoints’ total amount
of hazardous waste and radioactive waste (paragraph 39) is – as all the topical Disclosure
Requirements – subject to double materiality and to the materiality of information as stipulated
in ESRS 1 Chapter 3 – Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures:
(a) Is the ‘waste’ subtopic material? – The undertaking shall only disclose the datapoints of
the waste subtopic of ESRS E5 if considered material under double materiality (see ESRS 1
Chapter 3.3 Double materiality); and if so,
(b) does the datapoint provide material information? – The metrics required to be disclosed
by ESRS E5-5 Waste, including ‘the total amount of hazardous waste and radioactive
waste generated by the undertaking’, shall only be disclosed if such information is
assessed to be material and may be omitted if not (ESRS 1 paragraph 34).
Accordingly, it depends on materiality whether radioactive waste from analytical devices and
tracer applications shall be reported. See also ESRS 1 paragraphs 36 and 42 on establishing
appropriate thresholds when disclosing metrics.
It is noted that the datapoints of ESRS E5 paragraph 39 derive from other EU legislation as listed
in Appendix B of ESRS 2 and that ESRS 2 paragraph 56 applies. This means that, if applicable (i.e.
the amount of radioactive waste is not material for reporting purposes), the undertaking shall
flag that the amount of radioactive waste that is not material in accordance with ESRS 1
paragraph 35.

Background
The question received: ‘What is the logic according to Flowchart E of ESRS 1 for determining
Disclosure Requirements for transition plans and processes?’ has been reworded to the above to
be clearer.
ESRS 1 Appendix E – Flowchart for determining disclosures under ESRS presents the reasoning to
determine disclosures when a topic covered by a topical standard is material. In such case, the
related policies, actions and targets shall be disclosed, or it shall be stated that the undertaking
does not have policies, actions and/or targets related to the material sustainability matter. The
undertaking may report a timeframe in which it aims to have these in place (ESRS 1 paragraph 33).
ESRS 1 Appendix E – Flowchart for determining disclosures under ESRS states: ‘… Disclosure
Requirements in relation to action plans, targets, policies, scenario analysis and transition plans
are proportionate because they are contingent on the undertaking having these, …’
ESRS 1 Appendix E – Flowchart for determining disclosures under ESRS does not include
information on the Disclosure Requirements related to transitions plans (E1-1 and E4-1). It does
not include, either, information on the Disclosure Requirements related to the processes in the
ESRS S1 to S4: Processes for engaging with stakeholders about impacts (S1-2, S2-2, S3-2 and S4-2)
and processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for stakeholders to raise concerns (S1-
3, S2-3, S3-3 and S4-3).
ESRS E1-1 paragraph 17 states: ‘In case the undertaking does not have a transition plan in place,
it shall indicate whether and, if so, when it will adopt a transition plan.’
The Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘Actions’ as: ‘Actions refer to (i) actions and
action plans (including transition plans) that are undertaken to ensure that the undertaking
delivers against targets set and through which the undertaking seeks to address material impacts,
risks and opportunities; and (ii) decisions to support these with financial, human or technological
resources.’
The Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘Transition plan’ as: ‘A specific type of action
plan that is adopted by the undertaking in relation to a strategic decision and that addresses:
(a) a public policy objective; and/or
(b) an entity-specific action plan organised as a structured set of targets and actions,
associated with a key strategic decision, a major change in business model, and/or
particularly important actions and allocated resources.’
Answer
The flowchart in Appendix E of ESRS 1 provides an illustration of the provisions in ESRS on
materiality.
The Flowchart refers to actions (as well as policies and targets) which by definition also comprises
transition plans.

covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.
ESRS 1 paragraph 33 states for policies, actions and targets: ‘When disclosing information on
policies, actions and targets in relation to a sustainability matter that has been assessed to be
material, the undertaking shall include the information prescribed by all the Disclosure
Requirements and datapoints in the topical and sector-specific ESRS related to that matter and in
the corresponding Minimum Disclosure Requirement on policies, actions, and targets required
under ESRS 2. If the undertaking cannot disclose the information prescribed by either the
Disclosure Requirements and datapoints in the topical or sector-specific ESRS, or the Minimum
Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2 on policies, actions and targets, because it has not adopted the
respective policies, implemented the respective actions or set the respective targets, it shall
disclose this to be the case and it may report a timeframe in which it aims to have these in place.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states regarding metrics: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a
material sustainability matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical
ESRS, the undertaking:
(a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such
information to be material; and
(b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 114 states: ‘When the undertaking includes in its sustainability statement
additional disclosures stemming from (i) other legislation which requires the undertaking to
disclose sustainability information, or (ii) generally accepted sustainability reporting standards
and frameworks, including non-mandatory guidance and sector-specific guidance, published by
other standard-setting bodies (such as technical material issued by the International Sustainability
Standards Board or the Global Reporting Initiative), such disclosures shall:
(a) be clearly identified with an appropriate reference to the related legislation, standard or
framework (see ESRS 2 BP-2, paragraph 15);
(b) meet the requirements for qualitative characteristics of information specified in
Chapter 2 and Appendix B of this Standard.’
ESRS 1 paragraph QC 17 states regarding the qualitative characteristic of ‘understandability’:
‘Concise disclosures shall only include material information. Complementary information

presented pursuant to paragraph 114 shall be provided in a way that avoids obscuring material
information.’
Answer
(1) If water consumption is only deemed material for the value chain (and not material to
own operations), is the undertaking still allowed to include this datapoint in its
sustainability statement?
If water consumption is only deemed material in relation to impacts, risks or opportunities that
arise in the upstream or downstream value chain and not in own operations, the most relevant
metric to be included is the water consumption for the value chain only. This is not a metric
explicitly included in the sector-agnostic ESRS (ESRS E3 paragraph 24 (a) being focused on own
operations). However, even if no datapoint in ESRS E3 is identified as material, the undertaking
shall consider whether this or another metric that depicts this matter shall be disclosed as entity-
specific disclosure following ESRS 1 paragraph 11. See also Question ID 442 – Entity-specific
metrics.
As stated in ESRS 1 paragraph 34 (b) in respect of metrics for a material sustainability matter, an
undertaking ‘may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if
it assesses such information to be not relevant based on the ESRS 1 paragraph 31 criteria and
concludes that such information is not needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure
Requirement.’
The undertaking assesses the datapoint of ESRS E3 paragraph 24 (a) to be not material
information. Accordingly, based on ESRS 1 paragraph 34 (b) the undertaking may omit this
datapoint even though the sustainability matter of water consumption is material (because it
relates to material impacts, risks or opportunities in the value chain).
As ESRS 1 paragraph 34 (b) states that ‘the undertaking may omit’, this implies that the
undertaking does not have to omit the datapoint. Put differently, ‘may omit’ does not mean ‘shall
omit’. Therefore, it can be included in the sustainability statement.
In addition, the undertaking shall consider requirements of ESRS 1 in Chapter 2 Qualitative
characteristics of information whereby material information is not obscured by immaterial
information.
(2) If water consumption is not material for the undertaking (neither in relation to IROs
that arise in own operations nor for those that arise in upstream and downstream value
chain) but third parties ask the undertaking to include this datapoint in its sustainability
statement, is this allowed?
It depends. Following the provisions in ESRS 1 paragraph 114, in addition to the disclosure of
material matters identified during the materiality assessment process, the undertaking may
provide additional information stemming from other legislation as well as from generally
accepted sustainability reporting standards and frameworks (for example, SASB Standards or GRI
Standards). Other voluntary additional disclosures require the application of professional
judgement, are expected to be limited (i.e. disclosure is based on robust reasoning) and shall fulfil
the criteria laid out in ESRS 1 Appendix B Qualitative characteristics of information. This requires
that: ‘Complementary information … be provided in a way that avoids obscuring material
information.’

Question asked
(1) Shall a matter included in the financial statements of the undertaking that is outside of
its value chain be reported in the undertaking’s financial materiality assessment?
(2) There is uncertainty as to whether a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) would enter the
scope of the value chain of the undertaking, and more specifically, (i) in the case of a VPPA
and (ii) in the case of a DPPA.
ESRS Reference
ESRS 1 Chapter 3.5 Financial materiality, paragraphs 49 and 63
Key terms
Value chain; financial materiality; power purchase agreements
Background
As part of the question, the submitter also stated: ‘While Section 3.5 Financial materiality does
not mention that the matter shall be part of the undertaking’s value chain, the related notions of
risks and opportunities are used in the rest of the document as “in the undertaking’s value chain”.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 49 states: ‘A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it
triggers or could reasonably be expected to trigger material financial effects on the undertaking.
This is the case when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have a material
influence or could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the undertaking’s
development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of
capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Risks and opportunities may derive from past
events or future events. The financial materiality of a sustainability matter is not constrained to
matters that are within the control of the undertaking but includes information on material risks
and opportunities attributable to business relationships beyond the scope of consolidation used
in the preparation of financial statements.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 63 states: ‘The information about the reporting undertaking provided in the
sustainability statement shall be extended to include information on the material impacts, risks
and opportunities connected with the undertaking through its direct and indirect business
relationships in the upstream and/or downstream value chain (“value chain information”).’

A power purchase agreement (PPA), or electricity power agreement, is a long-term contract
between an electricity generator and a customer, usually a utility, government or company. The
PPA defines the conditions of the agreement such as the amount of electricity to be supplied,
negotiated prices, accounting and penalties for non-compliance. Since it is a bilateral agreement,
a PPA can take many forms and is usually tailored to specific applications. The power generated
might be renewable. Under a PPA, the customer is strictly speaking paying a provider for the
energy received. Therefore, in the case of renewable energy the undertaking will not necessarily
get the ancillary benefits of owning the renewable energy asset, such as the ability to get tax
rebates or sell renewable energy credits.
PPAs might be in the form of a physical-PPA (where the customer receives a fixed amount of
energy at a fixed price) or a virtual-PPA (where the customer receives/pays cash for a fixed
amount of energy based on the difference between a fixed and a variable price per unit).
Often those contracts result in parties involved receiving renewable energy certificates (‘RECs’).
Answer
(1) Shall a matter included in the financial statements of the undertaking that is outside of
its value chain be reported in the undertaking's financial materiality assessment?
A transaction or contract included in the financial statements and the sustainability matter related
to it cannot be considered outside the value chain. Therefore, a PPA, be it physical or virtual, is
considered as being in own operations (noting that value chain comprises upstream and
downstream value chain as well as own operations; see Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms).
Financial materiality in the sustainability statement includes items that arise from the
undertaking’s own operations and items that arise in its value chain.
A matter is material for inclusion in the sustainability statement from a financial materiality
perspective when it generates risks or opportunities that have a material influence or could
reasonably be expected to have a material influence on the undertaking’s development, financial
position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-,
medium- or long-term (see ESRS 1 paragraph 49).
(2) There is uncertainty as to whether a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) would enter the
scope of the value chain of the undertaking, and more specifically, 1) in the case of a
VPPA and (2) in the case of a DPPA.
A counterparty to the power purchase agreement is connected with the undertaking’s activities
(see ESRS 1 paragraph 63).
A physical-PPA results in the delivery of energy, and as it relates to indirect emissions from the
perspective of the purchaser of energy, falling under Scope 2 emissions under the GHG Protocol.
A virtual-PPA is a financial instrument resulting in the exchange of cash often combined with
certificates received by the reporting undertaking to affect the energy mix of the undertaking. As
this is part of the undertaking’s activities (to manage its energy costs or to obtain Guarantees of
Origin (or Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC)), this is part of its own operations and not its value
chain. The purchased Guarantees of Origin may ultimately affect the categorisation of Scope 2
disclosures under ESRS E1, whether surrendered or not. Please note that aforementioned does
relate only to the virtual PPA relationship and not to the one between the undertaking and the
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 41 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
party delivering physical energy, which often exists in the three-party relationship involving
virtual-PPAs.
As the substance of the contracts differ between physical and virtual PPAs, the undertaking’s
material impacts on people and environment and the material effects of sustainability matters on
the undertaking’s development, performance and condition might also differ.

Question ID 821 – Risk and opportunity for financial materiality
Release date
July 2024
Question asked
Regarding financial materiality, there are matters that trigger exposure to risks or opportunities
only and others that trigger the exposure to both. In the case of a matter that triggers exposure
to both risks and opportunities, should the assessment of materiality be made on each
individually or is it on the combined financial risk and opportunity?
In addition to the question asked, the submitter provided the following background to the
question: ‘For example, if we take energy as a topic, energy consumption is a financial risk
because the cost of energy can fluctuate significantly. But there is also an opportunity in terms of
reduced energy costs if the company invests in renewable energy and energy-efficient appliances.
In this case, should the financial risk be assessed separately from the financial opportunity? Or
should there be some assessment of what would weigh stronger in the balance, risk or
opportunity and assess accordingly?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapter 3.5 Financial materiality paragraphs 49 to 51 and AR 14 to 15
Key terms
Financial materiality; sustainability matters generating sustainability risks or opportunities
Background
ESRS 1 paragraphs 49 to 51 state:
‘49. A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it triggers or could
reasonably be expected to trigger material financial effects on the undertaking. This is the
case when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have a material
influence or that could reasonably be expected to have a material influence on the
undertaking’s development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 42 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Risks and opportunities
may derive from past events or future events. The financial materiality of a sustainability
matter is not constrained to matters that are within the control of the undertaking but
includes information on material risks and opportunities attributable to business
relationships beyond the scope of consolidation used in the preparation of financial
statements.
50. Dependencies on natural, human and social resources can be sources of financial risks or
opportunities. Dependencies may trigger effects in two possible ways:
(a) they may influence the undertaking’s ability to continue to use or obtain the
resources needed in its business processes as well as the quality and pricing of those
resources; and
(b) they may affect the undertaking’s ability to rely on relationships needed in its
business processes on acceptable terms.
51. The materiality of risks and opportunities is assessed based on a combination of the
likelihood of occurrence and the potential magnitude of the financial effects.’
Regarding sustainability-related risks or opportunities, ESRS 1 paragraph AR 14 states: ‘The
identification of risks and opportunities that affect or could reasonably be expected to affect the
undertaking’s financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of
capital over the short-, medium- or long-term is the starting point for financial materiality
assessment. In this context, the undertaking shall consider: …
(b) their classification as sources of:
i. risks (contributing to negative deviation in future expected cash inflows or increase in
deviation in future expected cash outflows and/or negative deviation from an
expected change in capitals not recognised in the financial statements); or
ii. opportunities (contributing to positive deviation in future expected cash inflows or
decrease in deviation in future cash outflows and/or positive deviation from expected
change in capitals not recognised in financial statements).’
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 15 states: ‘Once the undertaking has identified its risks and opportunities, it
shall determine which of them are material for reporting. This shall be based on a combination of
(i) the likelihood of occurrence and (ii) the potential magnitude of financial effects determined on
the basis of appropriate thresholds. In this step it shall consider the contribution of those risks
and opportunities to financial effects in the short-, medium- and long-term based on:
(a) scenarios /forecasts that are deemed likely to materialise; and
(b) potential financial effects related to sustainability matters deriving either from situations
with a below the “more likely than not” threshold or assets/liabilities not, or not yet,
reflected in financial statements. This includes:
i. potential situations that following the occurrence of future events may affect cash
flow generation potential;
ii. capitals that are not recognised as assets from an accounting and financial
reporting perspective but have a significant influence on financial performance,
such as natural, intellectual (organisational), human, social and relationship
capitals; and
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 43 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
iii. possible future events that may have an influence on the evolution of such
capitals.’
Answer
When the nature of an opportunity or a risk relating to a sustainability matter is different, it shall
be assessed separately.
In the example provided, the submitter states that energy consumption is a source of (financial)
risk because the cost of energy can fluctuate significantly (upside and downside price risk).
However, he has also identified an investment opportunity in terms of reduced energy costs in
the case that the company invests in renewable energy and energy-efficient appliances.
In financial terms, an undertaking that is more exposed to a risk (higher prices for supplies, lower
prices for sold products) than expected is also exposed to positive deviations when prices for
supplies /sold products will be below /above expectations. The positive deviations are not
necessarily identified as separate opportunities but assessed together with the risk. In the
example above, it is the action of investing in renewable energy that creates the opportunity to
reduce energy expenses.
Supporting material
IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information also
stresses regarding (financial) materiality in paragraph B15 the importance of expectations in the
materiality assessment: ‘The decisions described in paragraph B14 [i.e. decisions of primary users
related to providing resources to the entity] depend on primary users’ expectations about
returns, for example, dividends, principal and interest payments or market price increases. Those
expectations depend on primary users’ assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of
future net cash inflows to the entity and on their assessment of the stewardship of the entity’s
economic resources by the entity’s management and its governing body/bodies or individual(s).’

Key terms
Decimals, rounding; metrics, rounding; materiality of information
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability
matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking:
(a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such
information to be material; and
(b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
Answer
ESRS does not have specific rules for rounding or prescribing the number of decimals to be used
for percentages.
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 clarifies how that materiality of information applies to metrics. Accordingly,
the materiality of information also applies to rounding and decimals to be used for a percentage
metric. The undertaking may omit decimals and use rounding if it considers the information not
conveyed through omitting decimals and using rounding to be not material.
Materiality of information needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis depending on fact patterns
such as the size of the company, the metric to be disclosed and the materiality of the topic.

Background
The question received by the submitter: ‘Our judgment is that one topic is not material for our
enterprise, but that it will most probably become material within four to five years. Should we
state the topic as non-material or as material (the business plan approved by the shareholders
and sent to banks is for a three-year duration)?’ was split into two questions and rephrased to
the above question to better separate the issues asked. The submitter gave the following
background information to the question: ‘Water consumption will most probably become a
material topic in Southern Europe for many preparers within five to ten years …’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 43 states:’ A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when
it pertains to the undertaking’s material actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on
people or the environment over the short-, medium- or long-term.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 49 states: ‘A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it
triggers or could reasonably be expected to trigger material financial effects on the undertaking.
This is the case when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have a material
influence, or could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the undertaking’s
development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of
capital over the short-, medium- or long-term.’
Answer
(1) Consider an undertaking that has a business plan approved by for a three-year duration.
The undertaking expects a given impact or risk to arise in four to five years and be material
then. Shall the matter be considered material for the reporting period?
Yes, the materiality assessment is not limited to a business plan time-horizon.
The submitter clarifies that the topic in question relates to water consumption that will most
probably become a material topic in Southern Europe for many preparers within five to ten years,
which is a time horizon longer than the one used in the approved business plan.
The key question for the assessment of materiality from a financial point of view is whether water
consumption generates for the undertaking risks or opportunities that have a material influence
or that could reasonably be expected to have a material influence on the undertaking’s
development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of
capital over the short-, medium- or long-term (ESRS 1 paragraph 49). This is not limited to material
influence within the time horizon of the last approved business plan of the undertaking.

As stated in Implementation Guidance 1 – Materiality assessment FAQ 7 How frequently should
an undertaking update its sustainability materiality, ‘the materiality assessment is a dynamic
process subject to the inherent evolution of the undertaking and needs to be considered for an
update on an ongoing basis.’ Acknowledging such a dynamic process, it is possible that a matter
assessed today be considered material neither from an impact nor from a financial perspective,
but this assessment may change sometime in the future. This may happen if assumptions that
have been used in the impact and financial materiality assessment today do not materialise as
expected.

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
Yes. ESRS 1 paragraph 43 states for impact materiality, and paragraph 49 for financial materiality,
that: ‘A sustainability matter is material … when it pertains to / if it triggers … over the short-,
medium- or long-term.’ The time horizons are connected with an ‘or’, meaning that the impact /
financial materiality must not occur during all three-time horizons. It is sufficient that materiality
occurs during any of the time horizons.
If a matter is assessed as material in the long-term, the matter is considered material, and the
related Disclosure Requirements are applicable. Attention should be paid to the possible omission
of metrics when following paragraph 43 of ESRS 1.

included?
ESRS Reference

Key terms
Metrics; non-material Disclosure Requirement; datapoints
Background
The question received was ‘When doing the translation from the double materiality assessment’s
outcomes to Disclosure Requirements and datapoints (regarding a metric), is it possible that
datapoints are in scope when the related Disclosure Requirement is out of scope (non-material
Disclosure Requirement)?’ and was reworded for clarity.
The following background to the question was provided by the submitter: ‘After the double
materiality assessment, we translate the outcomes to which disclosure requirements are
applicable. Thereafter, we assess which datapoints are applicable. The question arises whether
specific datapoints within a disclosure requirement that is assessed to be out of scope could be in

scope. So, for example, ESRS S1-14 is out of scope, but one of the datapoints is in scope / the
company wants to report on it. Is that possible?’
ESRS 1 paragraph 16 states: ‘ESRS structure the information to be disclosed under Disclosure
Requirements. Each Disclosure Requirement consists of one or more distinct datapoints. The term
“datapoint” can also refer to a narrative sub-element of a Disclosure Requirement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 31 states: ‘The applicable information prescribed within a Disclosure
Requirement, including its datapoints, or an entity-specific disclosure shall be disclosed when the
undertaking assesses, as part of its assessment of material information, that the information is
relevant from one or more of the following perspectives:
(a) the significance of the information in relation to the matter it purports to depict or
explain; or
(b) the capacity of such information to meet the users’ decision-making needs, including the
needs of primary users of general-purpose financial reporting described in paragraph 48
and/or the needs of users whose principal interest is in information about the
undertaking’s impacts.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability
matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking:
(a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such
information to be material; and
(b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
Answer
No, it is not possible for a datapoint(s) to be material and for the related Disclosure Requirement
not to be material when disclosing information on metrics.
ESRS structure the information to be disclosed under Disclosure Requirements, and each
Disclosure Requirement consists of one or more distinct datapoints (ESRS 1 paragraph 16). One
datapoint (or more) related to a Disclosure Requirement in a topical standard assessed as material
makes that Disclosure Requirement material. Conversely, if all datapoints of a topical Disclosure
Requirement are assessed as not material, the related topical Disclosure Requirement is not
material.
However, it may be possible to conclude that an individual datapoint (or datapoints) are not
material while the corresponding Disclosure Requirement is material. Therefore, it is possible for
the entity to conclude that not all datapoints need to be provided to fulfill the information
requirements for a specific Disclosure Requirement.

What is the level of disaggregation in the sustainability statement of a group with multiple legal
entities per country in the EU and outside EU?
ESRS Reference
ESRS 1 Chapter 3.7 Level of disaggregation, paragraphs 54, 55 and 102
Key terms
Level of disaggregation
Background
The following background was provided with the question asked: ‘The ESRS Chapter 3.7 explains
the case where an undertaking shall or shall not disaggregate the reported information (focusing
here on the datapoints). It explains the possibility of disaggregating by country or by site when
there are significant variations/impacts’. The following questions that were received relate to the
granularity/breakdown of the data to be reported by a Group headquartered in the EU with
several legal entities per country in the EU and outside the EU and possibly a legal entity in one
country which owns some sub-entities in the country or abroad:
(a) Is it mandatory for the group to report datapoints per legal entity, or is it only in the case
of variation / impact materially that a specific entity detail shall be reported?
(b) If the group reports only aggregated data at the group level, does it mean that a specific
legal entity (in the EU) will be able to share ‘only’ group datapoints and not the specific
information related to its legal entity?
ESRS 1 paragraphs 54 and 55 state:
‘54. When needed for a proper understanding of its material impacts, risks and opportunities, the
undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information:
(a) by country, when there are significant variations of material impacts, risks and
opportunities across countries and when presenting the information at a higher level of
aggregation would obscure material information about impacts, risks or opportunities;
or
(b) by significant site or by significant asset, when material impacts, risks and opportunities
are highly dependent on a specific location or asset.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 50 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
55. When defining the appropriate level of disaggregation for reporting, the undertaking shall
consider the disaggregation adopted in its materiality assessment. Depending on the
undertaking’s specific facts and circumstances, a disaggregation by subsidiary may be
necessary.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 102 states: ‘When the undertaking is reporting at a consolidated level, it shall
perform its assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities for the entire consolidated
group regardless of its group legal structure. It shall ensure that all subsidiaries are covered in a
way that allows for the unbiased identification of material impacts, risks and opportunities.
Criteria and thresholds for assessing an impact, risk or opportunity as material shall be
determined based on Chapter 3 of this Standard.’
Answer
Determining the appropriate level of disaggregation involves judgement. The key driver is to
provide fair presentation in relation to the specific disclosure objective of a Disclosure
Requirement or datapoint.
Disaggregation depends on (a) variations of material impacts, risks and opportunities across
countries (e.g. across different sectors or business models) and (b) impacts, risks and
opportunities being highly dependent on a specific location (e.g. country) or asset as stipulated in
ESRS 1 paragraph 54.
ESRS 1 paragraph 56 further clarifies that, where data is aggregated, the undertaking shall ensure
that this aggregation does not obscure the specificity and context necessary to interpret the
information, nor should the undertaking aggregate material items that differ in nature.
Materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures, including the level of disaggregation (see
ESRS 1 Chapter 3.7 Level of disaggregation), is agnostic to the group’s legal structure.
In conclusion, the undertaking is expected to report at a legal entity level if for specific matters or
material IROs this corresponds to the criteria in ESRS 1 paragraph 54 and 56 (e.g. one legal entity
per country and ‘significant variations of material impacts, risks and opportunities across
countries’ as well as higher-level aggregation would obscure information).
When needed for a proper understanding of its material impacts, risks and opportunities, the
undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information by significant site or by significant asset
when material impacts, risks and opportunities are highly dependent on a specific location or
asset in accordance with ESRS 1 paragraph 54(b).
Conversely, the undertaking is expected to report information aggregated at group level (or for a
cluster of legal entities) if it assesses that a more granular level of disaggregation is not necessary.
In this case, the legal entities/subsidiaries are treated the same irrespective of their location
(within the EU or in non-EU territories) when they are included as part of the aggregated data,
with their share contributing to the respective datapoint (e.g. with their share of Scope 2 GHG
emissions, consumed energy – whether purchased or acquired externally, i.e. from third
parties/non-group entities in accordance with ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6) or their
share of the group’s employee characteristics as required by ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-
6 – Characteristics of the undertaking’s employees.

Question ID 41 - Financial institutions – scope of reporting boundary
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
What is the scope of own operations for an insurance company under ESRS? Is it the same as
under Solvency II, i.e. do the ESRS standards relate only to insurers’ non-life insurance activities
(fire, health, damage to vehicles, third part liability, assistance, legal expenses etc.), or also to
investment activities? How should the sustainability report address Insurance with profit
participation?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraphs 62 and 63.
Key terms
Insurance companies, financial Institutions, own operations, investment activities, reporting
boundary
Background
Articles 19a (3) and 29a (3) of the Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU) require that
reported information relates to the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and
downstream value chain.
ESRS do not define an undertaking’s ‘own operations.’
ESRS paragraph 62 states that: ‘The sustainability statement shall be for the same reporting
undertaking as the financial statements. For example, if the reporting undertaking is a parent
company required to prepare consolidated financial statements, the sustainability statement will
be for the group. This requirement does not apply where the reporting undertaking is not required
to draw-up financial statements or where the reporting undertaking is preparing consolidated
sustainability reporting pursuant to Article 48i of Directive 2013/34/EU.’
ESRS paragraph 63 states that: ‘The information about the reporting undertaking provided in
the sustainability statement shall be extended to include information on the material impacts,
risks and opportunities connected with the undertaking through its direct and indirect business
relationships in the upstream and/or downstream value chain (“value chain information”). In
extending the information about the reporting undertaking, the undertaking shall include
material impacts, risks and opportunities connected with its upstream and downstream value
chain:

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(a) following the outcome of its due diligence process and of its materiality assessment; and
(b) in accordance with any specific requirements related to the value chain in other ESRS.’
Answer
ESRS 1 paragraph 62 clarifies that the sustainability statement shall be prepared for the same
reporting undertaking as the financial statements. Therefore, the scope of own operations for an
insurance company is guided by the financial reporting requirements, which reflect the business
model, and is not necessarily the same as under Solvency II. See also IG 2 Value Chain chapter
2.3).
Following the definition of business relationship in Annex 2 of the ESRS Delegated Act, the
investments (including those related to insurances with profit participation) fall under the scope
of an undertaking’s business relationships. Therefore, investments are considered part of the
value chain and are subject to consideration in the materiality assessment of impacts, risks and
opportunities as established in ESRS 1 paragraph 63. Also refer to Implementation Guidance
EFRAG IG 2 Value Chain FAQ 2. When the undertaking has identified material impacts, risks or
opportunities that are connected to an investment business relationship, it must disclose them
(ESRS 1 chapter 5 Value chain).
Regarding investment activities, the sector-agnostic ESRS do not provide Disclosure Requirements
concerning specific metrics apart from GHG Scope 3. For GHG Scope 3, Category 15 (Investments)
is to be provided, if it is determined to be a significant category in accordance with ESRS E1
paragraphs 44 (c), AR 39 (a), AR 46 and AR 48.
EFRAG expects to add more guidance on these aspects in the forthcoming sector ESRS.

even if some of them:
(a) are located outside of the EU; and/or
(b) if some are not consolidated for financial statements purposes?

Key terms

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 53 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
The following question was received: ‘Does the (consolidated) sustainability statement of a parent
company have to include all its subsidiaries even if some of them are located outside of the EU
and/or if some are not (financially/legally) consolidated?’ and changed it to the above question
for clarity.
ESRS 1 paragraph 62 states: ‘The sustainability statement shall be for the same reporting
undertaking as the financial statements. For example, if the reporting undertaking is a parent
company required to prepare consolidated financial statements, the sustainability statement will
be for the group.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 90 states: ‘Data and assumptions used in preparing the sustainability statement
shall be consistent to the extent possible with the corresponding financial data and assumptions
used in the undertaking’s financial statements.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 102 states: ‘When the undertaking is reporting at a consolidated level, it shall
perform its assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities for the entire consolidated
group regardless of its group legal structure.’
The scope of consolidation of financial statements for undertakings organised as a group is
determined by either IFRS or national accounting laws, considering the requirements of the
Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU, specifically Article 21). Exemptions from the
consolidation of subsidiaries in the financial statements are provided under Article 23 (9) and (10)
of the Accounting Directive.
In addition to these provisions in practise subsidiaries sometimes may not be included in the
financial consolidation, based on materiality considerations, even though the legal obligation to
consolidate them exists.
Answer
The starting point of the sustainability statement is the perimeter used for financial reporting.
The consolidated sustainability statement of a parent company must include all its subsidiaries in
line with the scope of consolidation in financial reporting, even if some of them are located
outside of the EU.
The undertaking performs its assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities based on
the business model for the entire consolidated group. Subsidiaries that are immaterial for financial
statements and therefore are excluded from the consolidated perimeter when preparing financial
statements on an exceptional basis for practical considerations, or in line with national accounting
law, may still be material from a double materiality point of view. When this happens, they shall
be included in the reporting boundaries of the consolidated sustainability statement, despite
them being deemed immaterial for the consolidated financial statements.

Question asked
Should an undertaking prepare its ESRS consolidated sustainability statement following the
requirements relating to prudential consolidation laid down in Part One, Title II, chapter 2 of the
Capital Requirements Regulation (EU) 575/2013?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraph 62
Key Terms
Prudential consolidation
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 62 states: ‘The sustainability statement shall be for the same reporting
undertaking as the financial statements. For example, if the reporting undertaking is a parent
company required to prepare consolidated financial statements, the sustainability statement will
be for the group.’
In its answer to ID 2013-310 for Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), the European Banking
Authority states the following:
‘Article 18 (1) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) requires institutions to carry out a full
consolidation of all institutions and financial institutions which are its subsidiaries for the
application of prudential requirements on a consolidated basis.
Undertakings, other than institutions and financial institutions which neither acquire holdings nor
pursue any of the activities listed in points 2 to 12 and point 15 of Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU
(CRD), are excluded from the scope of prudential consolidation irrespective of whether or not
these undertakings are directly or indirectly held by the parent entity. As a result:
(a) Non-financial subsidiaries are excluded from the scope of prudential consolidation
regardless of whether these subsidiaries are fully held by a holding company. On the other
hand, the holding company is included for prudential consolidation purposes;
(b) Conversely, any holding company needs consolidating even when it holds no participation
in a financial subsidiary. However, all its participations are excluded for prudential
consolidation purposes.’
Answer
In accordance with ESRS 1 paragraph 62, sustainability statements shall be prepared for the
consolidated group; therefore, they shall not be grounded in a consolidation based on prudential
requirements. The reported information shall meet the qualitative characteristics of information
and the requirements in ESRS 1 paragraphs 54, 57 on level of disaggregation: on this basis, if
applicable and helpful to produce more understandable and relevant reporting, the undertaking
could disaggregate the reported disclosures between those related to the scope of financial
consolidation and those related to the scope of prudential consolidation. This is particularly
relevant if the undertaking uses the option to incorporate by reference information presented in
its Pillar 3 reports (ESRS 1 paragraphs 119/122).

ESRS 1 chapter 6 Time horizons
Question ID 180 - Time horizon: impact versus financial materiality
Release date
February 2024
Question asked
Is there a difference between the time horizon as defined in ESRS 1 for impact materiality and for
financial materiality?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapter 6.4 Definition of short-, medium- and long-term for reporting purposes
Key terms
Financial materiality; impact materiality; time horizon
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 77 states: ‘When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall
adopt the following time intervals as of the end of the reporting period:
(a) for the short-term time horizon: the period adopted by the undertaking as the reporting
period in its financial statements;
(b) for the medium-term time horizon: from the end of the short-term reporting period defined
in (a) up to five years; and
(c) for the long-term time horizon: more than five years.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 80 states: ‘There may be circumstances where the use of the medium- or long-
term time horizons defined in paragraph 77 results in non-relevant information, as the
undertaking uses a different definition for (i) its processes of identification and management of
material impacts, risks and opportunities or (ii) the definition of its actions and setting targets.
These circumstances may be due to industry-specific characteristics, such as cash flow and
business cycles, the expected duration of capital investments, the time horizons over which the
users of sustainability statements conduct their assessments or the planning horizons typically
used in the undertaking’s industry for decision-making. In these circumstances, the undertaking
may adopt a different definition of medium- and/or long-term time horizons (see ESRS 2 BP-2,
paragraph 9).’
ESRS 1 Basis of Conclusions paragraph 124 states: ‘The SRB discussed whether to prescribe
mandatory time horizons for short-, medium- and long-term for reporting purposes or whether
they should be entity-specific based on its business model, industry-characteristics, and its
planning horizon. Feedback from public consultation in that respect was ambiguous. Preparers
generally preferred an entity-specific approach to be able to use already existing data consistent
with their managerial processes, whereas users a more standardized approach for better
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 56 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
comparability across undertakings. Noticing that many of the forthcoming first-time sustainability
reporters need guidance, to increase comparability the SRB decided to prescribe conventional
time periods but to allow deviations from the medium- and long- term time horizons based on
entity-specific circumstances, acknowledging also that – depending on the sustainability matter
and sector concerned – other time horizons within the long-term horizon might be useful and
therefore prevail at topical level.’
Answer
Time horizons are defined in ESRS 1 chapter 6.4, setting fixed time horizons for the short-,
medium- and long-term with no distinction being made between impact and financial materiality.
However, ESRS 1 paragraph 80 acknowledges that there may be circumstances in which the
undertaking uses a different definition of its time horizons compared to the fixed time horizons
set in ESRS 1 paragraph 77. This exception to the general rule has been granted to take into
account entity-specific circumstances to manage sustainability-related impacts, risks and
opportunities.
When applying either the predefined time horizons or when the exception is used and as a result
another entity-specific time horizon is used instead of the predefined time horizon, potential or
actual impacts may have a different time horizon than risks or opportunities arising from the same
sustainability matter (and their related financial effects). Similarly, actions put in place to address
impacts may have a different time horizon than actions put in place to address risks or
opportunities. Transparency about time horizons is required in connection with impacts and
anticipated financial effects, as stated in ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48 (c) and (e).

Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 73 states: ‘The reporting period for the undertaking’s sustainability statement
shall be consistent with that of its financial statements.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 90 states: ‘Data and assumptions used in preparing the sustainability statement
shall be consistent to the extent possible with the corresponding financial data and assumptions
used in the undertaking’s financial statements.’
When making estimates, the qualitative characteristics of information shall be considered (see
ESRS 1 chapter 2 and Appendix B). Faithful representation requires information to be (i) complete,
(ii) neutral and (iii) accurate. Information can be accurate without being perfectly precise in all
respects. Accurate information implies that the undertaking has implemented adequate
processes and internal controls to avoid material errors or material misstatements. As such,
estimates shall be presented with a clear emphasis on their possible limitations and associated
uncertainty.
ESRS 1 paragraph 88 states: ‘An undertaking shall disclose information to enable users to
understand the most significant uncertainties affecting the quantitative metrics and monetary
amounts reported in its sustainability statement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 69 states: ‘There are circumstances where the undertaking cannot collect the
information about its upstream and downstream value chain as required by paragraph 63 after
making reasonable efforts to do so. In these circumstances, the undertaking shall estimate the
information to be reported about its upstream and downstream value chain by using all
reasonable and supportable information, such as sector-average data and other proxies.’
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 42 states with respect to Disclosure Requirements E1-6 - Gross Scopes 1, 2,
3, and Total GHG emissions: ‘An undertaking might have a different reporting period from some
or all of the entities in its value chain. In such circumstances, the undertaking is permitted to
measure its GHG emissions in accordance with paragraph 44 using information for reporting
periods that are different from its own reporting period if that information is obtained from
entities in its value chain with reporting periods that are different from the undertaking’s
reporting period, on the condition that:
(a) the undertaking uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain
to measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;
(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and
(c) the undertaking discloses the effects of significant events and changes in circumstances
(relevant to its GHG emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in
its value chain and the date of the undertaking’s general purpose financial statements.’
Answer
No, it is not possible to report metrics for a period which deviates from the financial year.
The reporting period for the undertaking’s sustainability statement shall be consistent with that
of its financial statements. Accordingly, the undertaking shall use consistent assumptions adopted
in the preparation of the financial statements for all metrics.
When reporting for a financial year from 1 July to 30 June, an undertaking starting for example
from the calendar year energy bill as a basis to calculate the energy consumption, shall make

Question asked
Could you please specify the short-term time horizon?
ESRS Reference
ESRS 1 paragraph 77 (a)
Key terms
Time horizon
Background
The following background to the question was provided by the submitter: ‘Since the short-term
time horizon is defined as “the period adopted by the undertaking as the reporting period in its
financial statements”, the question is whether short-term refers to the reporting period itself or
the year after the reporting period, and the reference does only clarify the length of the period. ‘
ESRS 1 paragraph 77 states: ‘When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall
adopt the following time intervals as of the end of the reporting period:
(a) for the short-term horizon: the period adopted by the undertaking as the reporting period
in its financial statements …’.
Answer
The short-term time horizon normally lasts one year, from the end of the reporting period.
The length of the short-term time horizon is defined as the period adopted by the undertaking in
its financial statement as the reporting period; this period extends from the end of the reporting
period into the future (ESRS 1 paragraph 77 (a)).
The reporting period adopted by the undertaking in its financial statements is in nearly all cases
one year (and in rare cases longer if the operating cycle is longer than one year (e.g. might be the
case for producers of whisky or cigars based on the definition of operating cycle in IFRS (IAS 1)).

Question asked
Does the company need to report data from previous years?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapters 7.1, 10.3 and 6.3
Key terms
Comparative information; base year
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 83 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose comparative information in respect
of the previous period for all quantitative metrics and monetary amounts disclosed in the current
period. When relevant to an understanding of the current period’s sustainability statement, the
undertaking shall also disclose comparative information for narrative disclosures.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 85 states: ‘Sometimes it is impracticable to adjust comparative information for
one or more prior periods to achieve comparability with the current period. For example, data
might not have been collected in the prior period(s) in a way that allows for either retrospective
application of a new definition of a metric or target or retrospective restatement to correct a prior
period error and it may be impracticable to recreate the information (see ESRS 2 BP-2). When it
is impracticable to adjust comparative information for one or more prior periods, the undertaking
shall disclose this fact.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 86 states: ‘When an ESRS requires the undertaking to present more than one
comparative period for a metric or datapoint, the requirements of that ESRS shall prevail.’
Some requirements (i.e., targets) provide the disclosure of the base year (see chapter 6.3 of
ESRS 1), defined as the historical reference date or period for which information is available and
against which subsequent information can be compared over time. In this context, comparative
information is required in respect of the base year for amounts reported in the current period
when reporting the developments and progress towards a target unless the relevant Disclosure
Requirement already defines how to report on progress.

ESRS 1 paragraph 136 states: ‘To ease the first-time application of this Standard, the undertaking
is not required to disclose the comparative information required by section 7.1 Presenting
comparative information in the first year of preparation of the sustainability statement under the
ESRS.’
Answer
Yes, the undertaking shall always report comparative information in respect of the previous
period for all quantitative metrics and monetary amounts disclosed in the current period.
Narrative disclosures shall only be disclosed for previous periods when relevant to an
understanding of the current period’s sustainability statement.
Special provisions apply when it is impracticable to disclose comparative information (ESRS 1
paragraph 85).
Some requirements (e.g., targets) request the disclosure of the base year when reporting on
progress towards a target. Comparative information is required in respect of the base year for
amounts reported in the current period when reporting the developments and progress towards
a target (ESRS 1 chapter 6.3).
A phase-in provision exists exempting undertakings for the first year of preparation of the
sustainability statement to provide comparative information (ESRS 1 paragraph 136).

ESRS 1 chapter 8 provides the basis for the presentation of information about sustainability
matters prepared in compliance with Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (i.e., the
sustainability statement) within the undertaking’s management report.
ESRS 2 paragraph 49 states: ‘The undertaking may disclose the descriptive information required
in paragraph 46 – ESRS 2 SBM-3 – alongside the disclosures provided under the corresponding
topical ESRS, in which case it shall still present a statement of its material impacts, risks and
opportunities alongside its disclosures prepared under this chapter of ESRS 2.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 11 specifies that the ESRS 2 General disclosures in topical standards shall be
presented alongside the disclosures required by ESRS 2 except for ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts,
risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model, for which the
undertaking has an option to present the disclosures alongside the topical disclosures.
Answer
In relation to the presentation of information required by a topical standard, flexibility is provided
to the undertaking as there are no specific requirements defining how an undertaking shall
present the reported information related to a specific topic required by a given topical standard.
Therefore, for a given material matter (for example, health and safety) the undertaking may
present the applicable disclosures on policies, actions, targets and metrics all together and does
not have to follow the structure of the disclosure requirements within the topical standard, such
as ESRS S1 Own workforce.
Regarding the overall sustainability reporting, ESRS 1 paragraph 115 clarifies that the sustainability
statement must be structured in four parts: ‘general information, environmental information,
social information and governance information’. A particular treatment is anticipated for ESRS 2
SBM-3 related disclosures1 required by topical standards, which can be either presented alongside
the other ESRS 2 General disclosures or alongside the respective topical disclosures
(environmental, social and governance). In case the ESRS 2 General disclosures required by topical
standards are presented alongside other topical disclosures, the undertaking still has to present a
statement of its material impacts, risks and opportunities alongside its disclosures prepared under
ESRS 2 SBM-3. Appendix F of ESRS 1 provides a non-binding structure for a sustainability
statement.

disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852), social information and governance
information. Respecting the provision in section 3.6 Material impacts or risks arising from actions
to address sustainability matters of this Standard, when information provided in one part contains
information to be reported in another part, the undertaking may refer in one part to information
presented in another part, avoiding duplications.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 49 states: ‘The undertaking may disclose the descriptive information required
in paragraph 46 (reference to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Disclosure Requirement) alongside the disclosures
provided under the corresponding topical ESRS, in which case it shall still present a statement of
its material impacts, risks and opportunities alongside its disclosures prepared under this chapter
of ESRS 2.’
ESRS 2-related disclosures in topical standards are identified by reference to ESRS 2 Disclosure
Requirements as follows: ‘Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 GOV-1 … ESRS 2 GOV-3 …
ESRS 2 SBM-2 … ESRS 2 SBM-3 … and … ESRS 2 IRO-1’.
Answer
ESRS 2-related Disclosure Requirements in topical standards must be reported in the general
section of the sustainability statement as they are part of the general disclosures of ESRS 2. They
are presented alongside the relevant ESRS 2 disclosure (e.g., ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-

For the descriptive information required in ESRS 2 paragraph 46 (ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement
SBM-3-related disclosures), there is an option to present them alongside the relevant topical
disclosure if the undertaking elects to follow the option in ESRS 2 paragraph 49.

Background
ESRS E5-5 states that an undertaking shall disclose information on its resource inflows, including
waste, related to its material impacts, risks and opportunities.
ESRS 1 paragraph 19 states that: ‘When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking
shall apply:
(a) the fundamental qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. relevance and faithful
representation; and
(b) the enhancing qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. comparability, verifiability
and understandability.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities . Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 73 states: ‘The undertaking shall apply the requirements for the content of
disclosures in this provision when it discloses on the metrics it has in place with regard to each

Yes, it is allowed, or even required, on an entity-specific basis following ESRS 1 paragraph 11, to
include quantitative data in the description of resource inflows, and to disclose additional non-
standardised metrics when such quantitative data are needed to enable users to understand the

management report. While you have provided a structure in ESRS 1 Appendix F, it seems to not
be detailed. Are we meant to follow the exact format as given under each ESRS? Is there a
template that can be provided to effectively disclose information?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapter 8, ESRS 1 Appendix F
Key terms
Structure of ESRS the sustainability statement
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 111 states: ‘Sustainability information shall be presented:
(a) in a way that allows for a distinction between information required by disclosures in ESRS
and other information included in the management report; and
(b) under a structure that facilitates access to and understanding of the sustainability
statement in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 115 states: ‘The undertaking shall structure its sustainability statement in four
parts in the following order: general information, environmental information (including
disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852), social information and governance
information. Respecting the provision in section 3.6 Material impacts or risks arising from actions
to address sustainability matters of this Standard, when information provided in one part contains
information to be reported in another part, the undertaking may refer in one part to information
presented in another part, avoiding duplications. The undertaking may apply the detailed
structure illustrated in Appendix F of this Standard.’

Answer
No, there is no requirement in ESRS to follow the exact format as given under each ESRS.
The only ESRS requirement is the following: ‘The undertaking shall structure its sustainability
statement in four parts in the following order: general information, environmental information
(including disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852), social information and
governance information.’ In addition, the undertaking may consider incorporation by reference
subject to the requirements in ESRS 1 chapter 9.1 Incorporation by reference.
ESRS 1 Appendix F provides an example on how to structure the sustainability statement aligned
with the general requirements under chapter 8 of ESRS 1 without further limiting the flexibility of
the preparers when presenting the related disclosures.
To note:
The structure of the sustainability statement shall meet the qualitative characteristics of
information (see ESRS 1 Appendix B).
The digital ESRS XBRL Taxonomy may help to prepare the sustainability statement in a structured
way. Starting to prepare the mapping of the information to be reported with the digital ESRS XBRL
Taxonomy will facilitate the subsequent tagging of the ESG information required by the machine-
readable format. Therefore, EFRAG encourages to take inspiration from the digital ESRS XBRL
Taxonomy to structure the sustainability disclosures. IG 3 List of ESRS Data Points offers a useful
tool to perform this exercise.
Currently, there is no detailed template for the sustainability statement. EFRAG might consider
providing a template in the future.

(1) In relation to Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) on policies, actions and targets,
shall the undertaking report them:
i. all aggregated in three blocks, each for policies, actions and targets; or
ii. disaggregated, i.e. each policy together with the related action(s) and target(s)?
(2) What if policies, actions or targets are related to more than one topical standard?

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
Structure of the sustainability statement; policies, actions and targets
Background
The question received, ‘In relation to MDR on policies, actions and targets, should the undertaking
report in each topical standard one or multiple policies, actions and targets? If so, should the
undertaking report topical datapoints related to each policy, action or target in one block or for
each policy?’ was modified to be able to address it more precisely and to add more nuance to the
question.
ESRS 1 paragraph 13 states: ‘The undertaking shall apply the minimum disclosure requirements
regarding policies, actions, metrics and targets together with the corresponding Disclosure
Requirements in topical and sector-specific ESRS.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 115 states: ‘The undertaking shall structure its sustainability statement in four
parts in the following order: general information, environmental information (including
disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852), social information and governance
information. Respecting the provision in Section 3.6 Material impacts or risks arising from actions
to address sustainability matters of this Standard, when information provided in one part contains
information to be reported in another part, the undertaking may refer in one part to information
presented in another part, avoiding duplications. The undertaking may apply the detailed
structure illustrated in Appendix F of this Standard.’
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 18 states: ‘As an illustration for paragraph 115 in section 8.2 Content and
structure of the sustainability statement of this Standard, the undertaking that covers
environmental and social matters in the same policy may cross-refer. That means that the
undertaking may report on the policy in its environmental disclosures and cross-refer to it from
the relevant social disclosures and vice versa. Consolidated presentation of policies across topics
is allowed.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 61 on MDR on policies and actions states: ‘The corresponding disclosures shall
be located alongside disclosures prescribed by the relevant ESRS. When a single policy or the
same actions address several interconnected sustainability matters, the undertaking may disclose
the required information in its reporting under one topical ESRS and cross-reference to it in its
reporting under other topical ESRS.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 71 on metrics and targets states: ‘The corresponding disclosures shall be
located alongside disclosures prescribed by the topical ESRS.’
ESRS 1 chapter 3.6 paragraphs 52 and 53 state:
‘52. The undertaking’s materiality assessment may lead to the identification of situations
in which its actions to address certain impacts or risks, or to benefit from certain
opportunities in relation to a sustainability matter, might have material negative
impacts or cause material risks in relation to one or more other sustainability
matters. For example:
(a) an action plan to decarbonise production that involves abandoning certain
products might have material negative impacts on the undertaking’s own
workforce and result in material risks due to redundancy payments; or
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 67 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(b) an action plan of an automotive supplier to focus on the supply of e-vehicles might
lead to stranded assets for the production of supply parts for conventional vehicles.
53. In such situations, the undertaking shall:
(a) disclose the existence of material negative impacts or material risks together with
the actions that generate them, with a cross-reference to the topic to which the
impacts or risks relate; and
(b) provide a description of how the material negative impacts or material risks are
addressed under the topic to which they relate.’
Answer
(1) In relation to Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) on policies, actions and targets,
shall the undertaking report them:
i. all aggregated in three blocks each for policies, actions, and targets; or
ii. disaggregated, i.e. each policy together with the related action(s) and target(s)?
The structure of the sustainability statement shall be presented in four parts as prescribed by
ESRS 1 paragraph 115. The undertaking shall apply the minimum disclosure requirements
regarding policies, actions, metrics and targets together with the corresponding Disclosure
Requirements in topical and sector-specific ESRS (ESRS 1 paragraph 13).
Both alternatives are possible provided that the qualitative characteristics of information (see
ESRS 1 chapter 2) are met. A combination of approach (a) and (b) is also possible. Reference from
one part of the sustainability statement to another is allowed, avoiding duplications (ESRS 1
paragraph 115).
(2) What if policies, actions or targets relate to more than one topical standard?
When a single policy or the same actions address more than one sustainability topic, the
undertaking may disclose the required information in its reporting under one topical ESRS and
cross-reference to it in its reporting under other topical ESRS (see ESRS 1 paragraph 61).
ESRS 2 paragraph 71 requires that metrics and targets be located alongside the disclosures
prescribed by the topical ESRS. ESRS 2 does not specify what to do when the same metric or the
same target covers more than one sustainability topic.

incorporated by reference:
(a) constitute a separate element of information and are clearly identified in the document
concerned as addressing the relevant Disclosure Requirement, or the relevant specific
datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement;
(b) are published before or at the same time as the management report;
(c) are in the same language as the sustainability statement;

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
It is possible to have the content index and the EU datapoint table as another section of the
management report.
The sustainability statement shall consist of four parts (ESRS 1 paragraph 56). The first part is
related to general information. As the content index and the datapoints that derive from other
EU legislation are part of the ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-2 – Disclosure Requirements in
ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement, they need to be included in the part
related to general information. However, information can, subject to the incorporation by
reference requirements of ESRS 1 paragraph 120, also be placed in ‘another section of the
management report’ (ESRS 1 paragraph 119 (a)).

Question asked
Can you explain and give more context to the datapoint in ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (f)?
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 chapter 9; ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (f)
Key Terms
Cross-reference to financial statements, ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-6
Background
ESRS S1-6 paragraph 50 (f) requires undertakings to disclose: ‘a cross-reference of the information
reported under (a) above to the most representative number in the financial statements.’
ESRS S1-6 paragraph 50 (a) requests the ‘total number of employees by head count and
breakdowns by gender and by country for countries in which the undertaking has 50 or more
employees representing at least 10% of its total number of employees.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 124 addresses the matter of connectivity with financial statements and states:
‘when the sustainability statement includes monetary amounts or other quantitative datapoints
that exceed a threshold of materiality and that are presented in the financial statements (direct
connectivity between information disclosed in sustainability statements and information
disclosed in financial statements), the undertaking shall include a reference to the relevant
paragraph of its financial statements where the corresponding information can be found.’

Directive 2013/34/EU, Article 16 describes the ‘Content of the notes to the financial statements
relating to all undertakings’ and requires the disclosure of (1)(h) ‘the average number of
employees during the financial year.’
Answer
This datapoint requirement is based on the principle of connectivity between the sustainability
statement and the financial statement, which is described in ESRS 1 chapter 9.2. In paragraphs
124 and 125 of this chapter, a distinction is made between direct connectivity (paragraph 124)
and indirect connectivity (paragraph 125). In both cases, the principle is that monetary or
quantitative amounts that exceed the threshold of materiality shall be cross-referenced from the
sustainability statement to the financial statements; for indirect connectivity, this means
explaining how these amounts relate to the most relevant amounts presented in the financial
statements. Where appropriate, a reconciliation may be provided, and it may be presented in
tabular form.
On this basis, the objective of ESRS 1 S1-6 paragraph 50 (f) is to cross-check the number of
employees required by paragraph 50 (a) against the most appropriate amount disclosed in the
financial statements. This includes the average number of employees during the year, disclosed
according to Article 16 of the Directive 2013/34/EU as transposed into the laws of each EU
Member State, and other relevant data if they are disclosed in the financial statements.
Given that ESRS S1-6 provides some flexibility in terms of methodology for calculating the head
count number of employees (i.e., average or at the end of the year), the undertaking is required
to disclose the methodology used as per paragraph 50 (d)(ii). If an undertaking uses a different
methodology for calculating the head count between the note to the financial statements and this
datapoint in ESRS S1-6 (e.g., average for the former, end of the year for the latter), it shall explain
the difference in the basis for calculation following the principle of connectivity defined in ESRS 1.

Background
ESRS 1 paragraphs 119 and 120 state:
‘119. Provided that the conditions in paragraph 120 are met, information prescribed by a
Disclosure Requirement of an ESRS, including a specific datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure
Requirement, may be incorporated in the sustainability statement by reference to:
(a) another section of the management report;
(b) the financial statements;
(c) the corporate governance statement (if not part of the management report);
(d) the remuneration report required by Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council (9);
(e) the universal registration document, as referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129(10); and
(f) public disclosures under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and
of the Council (11) (Pillar 3 disclosures). If the undertaking incorporates by reference
information from Pillar 3 disclosures, it shall ensure that the information matches the
scope of consolidation used for the sustainability statement by complementing the
incorporated information with additional elements as necessary.
120. The undertaking may incorporate information by reference to the documents, or part of
the documents, listed in paragraph 119, provided that the disclosures incorporated by
reference:
(a) constitute a separate element of information and are clearly identified in the
document concerned as addressing the relevant Disclosure Requirement, or the
relevant specific datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement;
(b) are published before or at the same time as the management report;
(c) are in the same language as the sustainability statement;
(d) are subject to at least the same level of assurance as the sustainability statement;
and
(e) meet the same technical digitalisation requirements as the sustainability statement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 56 states: ‘The undertaking shall include a list of the Disclosure Requirements
complied with in preparing the sustainability statement, following the outcome of the materiality
assessment (see ESRS 1 Chapter 3), including the page numbers and/or paragraphs where the
related disclosures are located in the sustainability statement. This may be presented as a content

legislation as listed in Appendix B of this Standard, indicating where they can be found in the
sustainability statement and including those that the undertaking has assessed as not material, in
which case the undertaking shall indicate “not material” in the table in accordance with ESRS 1
paragraph 35.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 72 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
Yes, it is mandatory to make explicit reference in the sustainability statement to the specific
Disclosure Requirement (and, where applicable, to the datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement)
when incorporating by reference. At the same time, it is also necessary to clearly identify in the
source document (i.e. the document that the sustainability statement refers to) the content that
the undertaking intends to incorporate by reference as the information that corresponds to the
relevant ESRS Disclosure Requirement (or the relevant specific datapoint) prescribed by an ESRS
Disclosure Requirement.
Incorporation by reference according to ESRS 1 paragraph 119 requires that all the conditions of
ESRS 1 paragraph 120 be met. One of those conditions is that the disclosure incorporated by
reference ‘constitute a separate element of information and be clearly identified in the document
concerned as addressing the relevant Disclosure Requirement(s), or the relevant specific
datapoint(s) prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement’ (see ESRS 1 paragraph 120(a)). Reference in
the sustainability statement only – for example, as part of the ‘content index’ as required by ESRS 1
paragraph 56 – to the sections that are incorporated by reference is not sufficient to meet the
ESRS 1 paragraph 120(a) requirement. A clear identification in the document incorporated by
reference (for example, in another section of the management report or the financial statements)
addressing the relevant Disclosure Requirement(s) or the datapoint(s) is also needed.

ESRS reference
ESRS 1 Appendix C: List of phase-in Disclosure Requirements
Key terms
Phase-in less than 750 employees, ESRS 2 related disclosures in topical standards
Background
For the topical standards of ESRS E4, S1, S2, S3 and S4, ESRS 1 Appendix C has the following phase-
in provision for all disclosure requirements of the respective ESRS:
‘Undertakings or groups not exceeding on their balance sheet dates the average number of 750
employees during the financial year (on a consolidated basis where applicable) may omit the
information specified in the disclosure requirements of ESRS (reference of the standard, see
above) for the first two years (for ESRS S1, “first year”) of preparation of their sustainability
statement.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 2 states: ‘In the preparation of disclosures under this Standard, the undertaking
shall apply the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) set in topical ESRS, as listed
in Appendix C of this Standard Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 74 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures. The undertaking shall apply the requirements
listed in Appendix C: (a) in all instances for the requirements in topical standards related to
Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material
impacts, risks and opportunities; and (b) for all other requirements listed in Appendix C only if the
sustainability topic is material based on the undertaking’s materiality assessment (see ESRS 1
chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures).’
ESRS 2 paragraph 17 states: ‘If an undertaking or group not exceeding on its balance sheet date
the average number of 750 employees during the financial year decides to omit the information
required by ESRS E4, ESRS S1, ESRS S2, ESRS S3 or ESRS S4 in accordance with Appendix C of ESRS
1, it shall nevertheless disclose whether the sustainability topics covered respectively by ESRS E4,
ESRS S1, ESRS S2, ESRS S3 and ESRS S4 have been assessed to be material as a result of the
undertaking’s materiality assessment. In addition, if one or more of these topics has been
assessed to be material, the undertaking shall, for each material topic:
(a) disclose the list of matters (i.e., topic, subtopic or sub-subtopic) in AR16 ESRS 1 Appendix A
that are assessed to be material and briefly describe how the undertaking’s business model
and strategy take account of the impacts of the undertaking related to those matters. The
undertaking may identify the matter at the level of topic, subtopic or sub-subtopic;
(b) briefly describe any time-bound targets it has set related to the matters in question, the
progress it has made towards achieving those targets, and whether its targets related to
biodiversity and ecosystems are based on conclusive scientific evidence;
(c) briefly describe its policies in relation to the matters in question;
(d) briefly describe actions it has taken to identify, monitor, prevent, mitigate, remediate or
bring an end to actual or potential adverse impacts related to the matters in question, and
the result of such actions; and;
(e) disclose metrics relevant to the matters in question.’
Answer
Yes.
ESRS 1 Appendix C states that the phase-in provisions relate to all disclosure requirements of the
topical standards. The term ‘all disclosure requirements’ also includes Disclosure Requirements in
the respective chapters in ‘ESRS 2 General Disclosures’ of the topical standards ESRS E4, S1, S2, S3
and S4.
However, the provisions of ESRS 1 Appendix C in relation to phase-in are to be read in conjunction
with ESRS 2 paragraph 17, which establishes minimum disclosures for the topics that have been
phased-in and that are material to the undertaking. To comply with these minimum disclosures,
a materiality analysis at the topical level is therefore needed to identify the material topics of ESRS
E4, S1, S2, S3 or S4.

Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 44 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose in metric tonnes of CO2eq its:
(a) gross Scope 1 GHG emissions;
(b) gross Scope 2 GHG emissions;
(c) gross Scope 3 GHG emissions; and
(d) total GHG emissions.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 133 states: ‘For the first three years of its sustainability reporting under the
ESRS, in order to take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in gathering
information from actors throughout their value chain and in order to limit the burden for SMEs
in the value chain:
(a) when disclosing information on policies, actions and targets in accordance with ESRS 2
and other ESRS, the undertaking may limit upstream and downstream value chain
information to information available in-house, such as data already available to the
undertaking and publicly available information; and
(b) when disclosing metrics, the undertaking is not required to include upstream and
downstream value chain information except for datapoints derived from other EU
legislation, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B.’
Answer
No, the transitional provisions outlined in ESRS 1 paragraphs 132 to 135 cannot be applied to
reporting Scope 3 emissions as required by ESRS E1 paragraph 44 (c). A phase-in exception applies
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 76 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
to undertakings or groups not exceeding on their balance sheet dates the average number of 750
employees during the financial year.
The disclosure of Scope 3 emissions is a datapoint derived from EU legislation, as indicated in
ESRS 2 Appendix B (Disclosure Requirement and related datapoint: ESRS E1-6 Gross Scope 1, 2, 3
and Total GHG emissions paragraph 44). Despite the transitional provisions of ESRS 1 paragraph
133 (b), datapoints derived from EU legislation, such as Scope 3 emissions, shall be reported.
It is, however, noteworthy that ‘undertakings or groups not exceeding on their balance sheet
dates the average number of 750 employees during the financial year (on a consolidated basis
where applicable) may omit the datapoints on Scope 3 emissions and total GHG emissions for the
first year of preparation of their sustainability statement’ (see ESRS 1 Appendix C: List of phased-

is not required to disclose the comparative information required by section 7.1 Presenting
comparative information in the first year of preparation of the sustainability statement under the
ESRS.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 137 states: ‘Appendix C: List of phased-in Disclosure Requirements in this
Standard sets phase-in provisions for the Disclosure Requirements or datapoints of Disclosure
Requirements in ESRS that may be omitted or that are not applicable in the first year(s) of
preparation of the sustainability statement under the ESRS.’
Answer
The voluntarily publication of sustainability statements one year earlier than required under the
CSRD does not affect the phase-in requirement periods granted by ESRS 1.
Voluntary early application of the ESRS sustainability statement by an undertaking does not count
in respect of the years of preparation under ESRS, is not recognised legally, and therefore does
not affect the date from when the phase-ins should be calculated. Accordingly, in the year of
mandatory application of ESRS, the undertaking may present its sustainability statement without
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 78 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
comparative information in accordance with ESRS 1 paragraph 136 even if it has prepared a
voluntary sustainability statement in the preceding year.
Question ID 1144 – Phase-in 750 employees: Calculation of average
number
Release date
November 2024
Question asked
In the phase-in section, companies with 750 or more employees shall start reporting from the
first year. The question is how to calculate the number of employees for this. Should it be done
on a headcount or a full-time-equivalent basis?
ESRS Reference
ESRS 1 Appendix C
Key terms
Phase-in less than 750 employees; phase-in requirements
Background
The question received, ‘In the phase-in section, companies with 750 or more employees have to
start reporting from the first year. The question is how to calculate the number of employees for
this. For, e.g., if I count by head count that a company has 800 employees, the company must
comply with ESRS and start reporting from the first year. But, if I count employees by FTEs, it is
700. So, the company can opt for phase-out’, was modified to the above question to be more
precise.
ESRS 1 Appendix C: List of phased-in Disclosure Requirements has six phase-in provisions
applicable for ‘undertakings or groups not exceeding on their balance sheet dates the average
number of 750 employees during the financial year (on a consolidated basis where applicable)’.
Answer
The ‘average number of employees’ shall be calculated in line with the size criteria as stipulated
in the Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU) Article 3.
The Accounting Directive in Article 3 used the term ‘average number of employees during the
financial year’. This is exactly the same term used in ESRS 1 Appendix C, aligning ESRS to the
wording and requirement used in the Accounting Directive. The Accounting Directive has been
transposed in the national laws of the Member States and it is expected that, based on this
transposition, each Member State or country has a well-established guidance and practice for
how to calculate the average number of employees during the financial year. The requirements
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 79 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
transposed in national law shall be applied to determine the number of employees for the ‘750
employee phase-in’ provision.
Accordingly, also considering connectivity with financial statements, the number calculated for
and reported in financial statements shall be consistent with that used for ESRS 1 Appendix C, i.e.
the ‘750 employee criteria’.

Key terms
ESRS 2-related disclosures in topical standards; structure of the sustainability statement
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 115 states: ‘The undertaking shall structure its sustainability statement in four
parts in the following order: general information, environmental information … social
information, and governance information. Respecting the provision in Section 3.6 Material
impacts or risks arising from actions to address sustainability matters of this Standard, when
information provided in one part contains information to be reported in another part, the
undertaking may refer in one part to information presented in another part, avoiding
duplications.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 2 states: ‘In the preparation of disclosures under this Standard, the undertaking
shall apply the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) set in topical ESRS, as listed
in Appendix C of this Standard Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are
applicable in conjunction with ESRS 2 General Disclosures. The undertaking shall apply the
requirements listed in Appendix C:
(a) in all instances for the requirements in topical standards related to Disclosure
Requirement IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts,
risks and opportunities; and
(b) for all other requirements listed in Appendix C, only if the sustainability topic is material
based on the undertaking’s materiality assessment (see ESRS 1 Chapter 3 Double
materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures).’
Answer
No, the ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirements do not overlap with the Disclosure Requirements in
topical ESRS with the exception of the Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDRs) in ESRS 2
Chapter 4.2 Minimum disclosure requirement on policies and actions and chapter 5 Metrics and
targets.
The MDR may overlap by definition with those in the topical standards as they are a checklist to
be used for completeness: i.e. when a datapoint in MDR is already covered by a topical standard,
undertakings are not supposed to report twice the same information.
Some Disclosure Requirements in the topical ESRS (labelled ‘Disclosure Requirement related to
ESRS 2 GOV-1, GOV-3, SBM-2, SBM-3 or IRO-1 …’ in the respective topical ESRS; see Appendix C of
ERSR 2) further specify the ESRS 2 disclosures in relation to the respective topical matter (see

has been assessed to be material, the undertaking shall, for each material topic:
(a) disclose the list of matters (i.e. topic, sub-topic or sub-sub-topic) in AR 16 ESRS 1 Appendix
A that are assessed to be material and briefly describe how the undertaking’s business
model and strategy take account of the impacts of the undertaking related to those matters.
The undertaking may identify the matter at the level of topic, sub-topic or sub-sub-topic;

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 83 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
the information specified in the disclosure
requirements of ESRS S4 for the first 2 years of
preparation of their sustainability statement.
Answer
The transitional provisions apply to undertakings or groups not exceeding on their balance sheet
dates the average number of 750 employees during the financial year (on a consolidated basis
where applicable). The option is to omit the information required by all the disclosure
requirements in the following topical standards: ESRS E4, ESRS S1, ESRS S2, ESRS S3 and ESRS S4.
The regime of these provisions varies depending on the topical standard. The transitional
provisions on ESRS S1 only apply to the first year of preparation of the undertaking’s sustainability
statement. For ESRS E4, ESRS S2, ESRS S3 and ESRS S4, the provisions apply to the first two years
of preparation of the sustainability statement.
When information about a topic is omitted, the undertaking is nevertheless required to include
the topic in the scope of the materiality assessment. When information required by one of these
topical standards is omitted but the topic is assessed to be material, ‘de minimis’ disclosures shall
be reported covering the material topic in question (ESRS 2 paragraph 17).
The materiality assessment covers the environmental, social and governance matters connected
to the undertaking as established by the CSRD (i.e., a climate-first approach or an environmental
only approach was not the intention of the co-legislators); the sustainability statement is to
include a holistic view of sustainability matters regardless of whether social standards are subject
to transitional provisions. Hence, the ESRS 2 paragraph 17 provision aims at ensuring that there
is a certain level of ‘minimal disclosures’ that are required regardless of whether the undertaking
chooses to apply the transitional provisions.
The transitional provisions allow undertakings to provide less granular information than what is
required after the transition period. The information to be provided for the matters are more
summarised (i.e., as briefly as referred to in the text) than the requirements set out in the five
topical standards mentioned above. The main simplifications in paragraph 17 compared to
paragraph 48 of ESRS 2 are the following:
(a) Paragraph 48 (a): Under ESRS 2 paragraph 17, the undertaking may choose to disclose at
topic, subtopic or sub-subtopic level, and separate disclosure of material impacts, risks
and opportunities is not required. The undertaking is not required to disclose where in its
business model, its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain
material IROs are concentrated.
(b) Paragraph 48 (b) relates to how the undertaking takes into account material impacts on
its strategy and business model. This information related to impacts can be disclosed at
a summarised level without all the granularity required by the datapoints therein.
(c) Paragraph 48 (c) to (h) sets requirements to disclose more detailed information about
material IROs. As these are not required to be identified in the transition period, these
datapoints do not form part of the ‘de minimis’ disclosures. While this is not a
requirement, in the transitional period it may be helpful to briefly disclose the
information on paragraph 48 (c) to contextualise the material impacts identified.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 84 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS 2 paragraph 17 (b) to (e) provides de minimis information corresponding to disclosure
requirements in topical standards in case an undertaking elects not to disclose topical information
in the transition period. The transitional provision requires a summarised description of the
policies, actions and targets and does not require to fulfil the detailed datapoints in MDR (P, T, A)
in ESRS 2 and/or topical standards.
Finally, for metrics, the undertaking is to apply judgement to fulfil the requirements of metrics in
topical standards. Such judgement relates to the number and nature of metrics disclosed (i.e., the
undertaking may disclose a reduced number of metrics and not all the metrics that are material)
and the level of granularity of the metric (for example, the metric may be presented at a global
level without breakdowns).

ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraph 115; ESRS 2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements paragraphs 61 and 71
Key words

ESRS 2 paragraph 61 states in respect of policies and targets: ‘The minimum disclosure
requirements on policies and actions shall be located alongside disclosures prescribed by the
relevant ESRS. When a single policy or same actions address several interconnected sustainability
matters, the undertaking may disclose the required information in its reporting under one topical
ESRS and cross-reference to it in its reporting under other topical ESRS.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 71 states in respect of metrics and targets: ‘The corresponding disclosures shall
be located alongside disclosures prescribed by the topical ESRS.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 85 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
The undertaking shall structure its sustainability statement in four parts (ESRS 1 paragraph 115).
ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement BP-2 (including its paragraph 17) is part of the general information
required by ESRS 2 and as such, on a literal reading of ESRS 1 paragraph 115, could be disclosed
as part of the general information, for example, together with the Disclosure Requirement SBM-
3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business
model.
However, based on ESRS 1 paragraph 115, environmental, social and governance related
information can – appropriately cross-referenced - also be disclosed with the respective
environmental, social and governance related parts of the sustainability statement. This is in line
with ESRS 2 paragraph 61 on the minimum disclosure requirement for policies and actions and
with ESRS 2 paragraph 71 on metrics and targets, both allowing information to be located
alongside disclosures prescribed by the relevant topical ESRS.

in which it aims to have these in place (see also ESRS 1 Appendix E: Flowchart for determining
disclosures under ESRS).
According to ESRS 1 paragraph 34, the undertaking shall disclose information on metrics if the
Disclosure Requirement or the individual datapoints are assessed to be material.

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Clarification is needed in the case where the information of a Disclosure Requirement or
datapoint on metrics is assessed as material but the undertaking does not have the information
available.
ESRS 2 paragraph 11 requires disclosures on sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty.
Answer
No, this is not the case for metrics. The treatment of paragraph 33 of ESRS 1 is limited to policies,
actions and targets and cannot be applied by analogy to metrics – to which paragraph 34 applies
instead. Material metrics are to be reported. If the metric cannot be determined through direct
data collection, it shall be estimated.
The level of measurement uncertainty of metrics is not a reason for omitting them. According to
ESRS 2 BP-2, if a metric is subject to a high level of measurement uncertainty, the undertaking
shall disclose information about the sources of measurement uncertainty (for example,
availability and quality of data) and disclose the assumptions, approximations and judgments that
the entity has made in measuring it.

Key terms
Administrative, management, and supervisory bodies
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 87 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
The Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘administrative, management and
supervisory bodies’ as follows:
‘The governance bodies with the highest decision-making authority in the undertaking include its
committees. If in the governance structure there are no members of the administrative,
management or supervisory bodies of the undertaking, the CEO and, if such function exists, the
deputy CEO should be included. In some jurisdictions, governance systems consist of two tiers,
where supervision and management are separated. In such cases, both tiers are included under
the definition of administrative, management and supervisory bodies.’
GRI is also a useful source of complementary guidance: GRI uses ‘highest governance body’ as
well in reference to the ‘administrative, management and supervisory bodies’. GRI 102 requires
jurisdictions with two tiers of governance bodies to consider both as ‘highest governance bodies’.
ESRS do not define the term ‘senior executive management’. However, GRI explicitly defines
‘senior executive management’ in GRI 102 as top-ranking members of the management of an
organisation including a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and individuals reporting directly to the CEO
or to the highest governance body. Each organisation defines which members of its management
teams are senior executives.
Undertakings might report the identity of their ‘management body’ and ‘governance body’ as part
of the corporate governance statement as they are key actors in the national corporate
governance codes. ESRS 1 paragraph 119 allows an undertaking to incorporate in the sustainability
statement information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement of ESRS, including a specific
datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement by reference to the corporate governance
statement (if not part of the management report), provided that the conditions in paragraph 120
are met.
Answer
As defined in Annex II of ESRS, administrative, management and supervisory bodies as a collective
have the highest decision-making authority. The governance bodies which are covered under this
definition can vary from one jurisdiction to another. This is because some jurisdictions have
different bodies for management and supervision, respectively, whereas others have one unique
body carrying out both roles.
‘Senior executive management’ must be understood as a higher position than a ‘management-
level position’.
In the description of their governance bodies and management, undertakings need to ensure
consistency between the sustainability statement and the corporate governance statement as
well as other corporate communications in general.

representatives in the board?
ESRS reference
ESRS 2 paragraph 21 (b)
Key terms
Representation of employees and other workers
Background
ESRS 2 paragraph 21 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the following information about the
composition and diversity of the members of the undertaking’s administrative, management and
supervisory bodies:…
(b) representation of employees and other workers …’.
GRI is also a useful source of complementary guidance since it also requires describing the
composition of the highest governance body and its committees. However, ESRS paragraph 21 (b)
requires reporting the representation of employees and other workers, whereas GRI 2-9-c-viii
requires reporting stakeholder representation, which includes but is not limited to employees and
other workers.
Answer
The undertaking shall disclose whether there are representatives of the undertaking’s employees
and other workers in their administrative, management and supervisory bodies. This is because
ESRS 2 paragraph 21 (b) requires information on the ‘representation of employees and other
workers’. These representatives are selected in line with EU / national legislation on worker
representation in administrative, management and supervisory bodies, i.e. being either elected
directly by the workforce or appointed by workers’ representative bodies, e.g. trade unions, works
councils or European works councils.

and the focus is on the Board of Directors, its committees and the CEO.

ESRS reference
ESRS 2 GOV-1
Key terms
Categorisation of the general meeting
Background
Annex II of the ESRS defines ‘administrative, management and supervisory bodies’ as follows: ‘The
governance bodies with the highest decision-making authority in the undertaking including its
committees. If in the governance structure there are no members of the administrative,
management or supervisory bodies of the undertaking, the CEO, and if such function exists, the
deputy CEO, should be included. In some jurisdictions, governance systems consist of two tiers,
where supervision and management are separated. In such cases, both tiers are included under
the definition of administrative, management and supervisory bodies.’
In contrast, the general meeting is a mandatory annual meeting in which an undertaking’s
shareholders or owners exercise their decision-making powers. Matters within the decision-
making power of the general meetings include the matters provided for in law or the articles of
association, such as the remuneration and appointment of directors and auditors, adoption of the
company’s financial statements, distribution of assets, discharge from liability of the executives,
amendments to the articles of association and decisions relating to the company’s shares or share
capital.
The Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the
annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain
types of undertakings makes a clear distinction between the general meeting (or shareholder
meeting) and the administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees.
Additionally, national Corporate Governance Codes make a similar distinction and provide
guidance and recommendations regarding best practices for both the general meeting and the
administrative, management and supervisory bodies.
Answer
No, the general meeting should not be considered an ‘administrative, management and
supervisory body’. It is a separate governance body with specific powers attributed to
shareholders or owners. The general meeting is not addressed by ESRS but instead by the
Accounting Directive using, however, the term ‘shareholder meeting’ with respect to the
Corporate Governance Statement and by the national Corporate Governance Codes.

ESRS 2 paragraph 20 states: ‘The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an
understanding of: …
(c) the expertise and skills of its administrative, management and supervisory bodies on
sustainability matters or access to such expertise and skills.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 23 states: ‘The disclosure shall include a description of how the administrative,
management and supervisory bodies determine whether appropriate skills and expertise are
available or will be developed to oversee sustainability matters, including:
(a) the sustainability-related expertise that the bodies, as a whole, either directly possess or
can leverage, for example through access to experts or training; and
(b) how those skills and expertise relate to the undertaking’s material impacts, risks and
opportunities.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 20 states: ‘The description of the level of expertise or access to expertise of the
administrative, management and supervisory bodies may be substantiated by illustrating the
composition of the bodies, including members on whom these bodies rely for expertise to oversee

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
The question received, ‘In the E1.GOV-3_02 requirement, could you please specify whether the
required percentage of current remuneration related to sustainability shall be calculated: (i) as a
percentage of variable remuneration, (ii) as a percentage of fixed remuneration or (iii) as a
percentage of total remuneration (fixed plus variable)?’, has been modified to the above question
for clarity. The submitter provided the following answer to the question: ‘Drawing a parallel
between ESRS E1.GOV-3_02 and ESRS 2 GOV-3_05, I would assume that the percentage of current
remuneration related to sustainability being asked shall be calculated as a percentage of variable
remuneration.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 29 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose: …
(d) the proportion of variable remuneration dependent on sustainability-related targets
and/or impacts …’.
ESRS E1 paragraph 13 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose … the percentage of remuneration
recognised in the current period that is linked to climate-related considerations …’.
Annual total remuneration is defined in Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms: ‘Annual total
remuneration to own workforce includes salary, bonus, stock awards, option awards, non-equity
incentive plan compensation, change in pension value, and nonqualified deferred compensation
earnings provided over the course of a year.’
Answer
(1) Is the ESRS 1 Disclosure Requirement GOV-3 on ‘the proportion of variable remuneration
dependent on sustainability-related targets and/or impacts’ (ESRS 2 paragraph 29(d))
calculated:
(a) as a percentage of variable remuneration;
(b) as a percentage of fixed remuneration; or
(c) as a percentage of total remuneration (fixed and variable)?
The ESRS 2 paragraph 29(d) metric shall be calculated as (a) a percentage of variable
remuneration.
ESRS 2 paragraph 29(d) requires the ‘proportion of variable remuneration dependent on
sustainability-related targets and/or impacts’ to be disclosed. According to this wording, the
numerator is the proportion of the variable remuneration dependent on sustainability-related
targets and/or impacts, and the denominator is the variable remuneration.
Though not explicitly stated in ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement GOV-3 (paragraph 29(d)), it shall be
assumed that remuneration is the amount recognised in the current period, i.e. the amount
recognised as an expense (i.e. regardless of whether or not it is paid out) under the applicable
accounting GAAP in the financial statements. This shall be done considering connectivity with
financial statements in line with the elements listed in the definition of ‘annual total
remuneration’ in Annex II and consistent with ESRS E1 paragraph 13, which explicitly refers to the
‘remuneration recognised’.
(2) Is the percentage to be disclosed under ESRS E1 Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2
GOV-3 Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes based on
the same denominator as under question (1) above?
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 93 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
No, it is not. The ESRS E1 paragraph 13 metric shall be calculated as a percentage of total
remuneration.
ESRS E1 paragraph 13 requires the ‘percentage of remuneration recognised’ to be disclosed. The
phrase used requires that the denominator be the remuneration recognised, i.e. the total of fixed
and variable remuneration recognised, and that the numerator be the ‘remuneration
recognised … that is linked to climate-related considerations’.
To note: There is no reason why the term ‘remuneration’ as used in both ESRS 1 paragraph 29 and
ESRS E1 paragraph 13 in respect of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies is not
to be read as being consistent with the definition of ‘annual total remuneration’, as defined in
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms in respect of own workforce.

Question ID 395 – Revenue/net revenue
Release date
July 2024
Question asked
What does net revenue mean? How is it calculated?
ESRS reference
All Disclosure Requirements require a breakdown of revenue or an intensity metric based on net
revenue, for example, ESRS 2 Disclosure requirement SBM-1 Strategy, business model and value
chain paragraph 40 (b); ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-5 Energy consumption and mix
paragraph 40; ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6 Gross scopes 1,2,3 and Total GHG emissions
paragraph 53; and ESRS Disclosure requirement E3-4 Water consumption paragraph 29.
Key terms
Revenue, net revenue, net turnover
Background
ESRS use the terms ‘revenue’, ‘total revenue’ and ‘net revenue’ as synonyms. ESRS 2 refers to
‘revenue’ or ‘total revenue’ (see ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement SBM-1 – Strategy, business model
and value chain) whereas ESRS E1 and the other environmental ESRS refer mostly to ‘net
revenue’.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 36 (e) states: ‘When preparing the information on energy intensity required
under paragraph 40, the undertaking shall calculate the net revenue in line with the accounting
standards’ requirements applicable for the financial statements, i.e., IFRS 15 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers or local GAAP requirements.’
ESRS do not use the term ‘net turnover’ as used by the Accounting Directive (Directive
2013/34/EU Article 2 (5)) The Accounting Directive defines ‘net turnover’ as the amounts derived
from the sale of products and the provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value
added tax and other taxes directly linked to turnover; however, for insurance undertakings
referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 1 (3) of this Directive, ‘net turnover’
shall be defined in accordance with Article 35 and point 2 of Article 66 of Council Directive
91/674/EEC; for credit institutions referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 1
(3) of this Directive, ‘net turnover’ shall be defined in accordance with point (c) of Article 43 (2)
of Council Directive 86/635/EEC; and for undertakings falling under the scope of Article 40a(1) of
this Directive, ‘net turnover’ means the revenue as defined by or within the meaning of the
financial reporting framework on the basis of which the financial statements of the undertaking
are prepared’.

The Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2178 specifying Article 8 of the Taxonomy Directive related to
environmental taxonomy disclosures also uses the term ‘net turnover’ (see the supporting

Answer
The terms ‘revenue’, ‘total revenue’ and ‘net revenue’ are to be understood as the amounts
presented in the income statement of the undertaking’s financial statements in accordance with
the applicable legislation and/or accounting standards, i.e. IAS 1 paragraph 82 (a)2 – if IFRS
Standards are applied – or generally accepted national accounting principles (national GAAP).

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
The submitter asked the following question, which was amended as stated above to align it with
the wording of ESRS 2 paragraph 40: ‘How is total income of a credit institution defined and how
is it divided into ESRS sectors? Is it the sector ‘credit institution’ or the sectors for the business
portfolio, i.e., the sectors of the financed portfolio?’
ESRS 2 paragraph 40 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the following information about the
key elements of its general strategy that relate to or affect sustainability matters … (b) a
breakdown of total revenue, as included in its financial statements, by significant ESRS sectors.’
ESRS 2 paragraph AR 12 states: ‘To provide the information on sectors required by paragraph 40,
the undertaking shall map its significant activities in accordance with ESRS sectors. If a code for a
subsector does not exist, the caption “others” shall be used.’
ESRS do not use the term ‘net turnover’ as used by the Accounting Directive (Directive
2013/34/EU Article 2 (5)). The Accounting Directive defines ‘net turnover’ (Directive 2013/34/EU
Article 2 (5)): ‘net turnover’ means the amounts derived from the sale of products and the
provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value added tax and other taxes directly
linked to turnover; however, for insurance undertakings referred to in point (a) of the first
subparagraph of Article 1 (3) of this Directive, ‘net turnover’ shall be defined in accordance with
Article 35 and point 2 of Article 66 of Council Directive 91/674/EEC; for credit institutions referred
to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 1 (3) of this Directive, ‘net turnover’ shall be
defined in accordance with point (c) of Article 43 (2) of Council Directive 86/635/EEC; …’
Council Directive 86/635/EEC of December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated
accounts of banks and other financial institutions, Article 43 (2) point (c), states: ‘The information

(b) 7. Other operating income …’
Answer
(1) How is total revenue of a credit institution defined?
Total revenue of a credit institution, according to ESRS 2 paragraph 40, is a proxy for ‘net turnover’
as defined in the Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU) Article 2 (5).
ESRS use the terms ‘revenue’, ‘total revenue’ and ‘net revenue’ as synonyms. ESRS 2 refers to
‘revenue’ or ‘total revenue’ (see ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement SBM-1 – Strategy, business model
and value chain) whereas ESRS E1 and the other environmental ESRS refer mostly to ‘net
revenue’. The three terms are referred to in ESRS in a more generic way as a proxy for ‘net
turnover’ as defined by the Accounting Directive by considering the revenue as defined by the
financial reporting framework applicable to the financial statements of the undertaking,
acknowledging in whatever way possible revenues that are defined under the applicable GAAP.
(2) How is it divided into ESRS sectors? Is it the sector ‘credit institution’ or the sectors for
the business portfolio, i.e., the sectors of the financed portfolio?
Credit institutions should not refer to the sectors of the financed portfolio for the purposes of
ESRS 2 paragraph 40. For presenting the revenue breakdown by ESRS sector, they should refer to
the sectors in which they directly operate, not the sectors in which their clients operate.

(2) Should an Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor of a Liquid Natural Gas
plant include its Engineering, Procurement and Construction revenues under this
caption?’
was reworded to the above question for clarity.
ESRS 2 paragraph 40 (d) states: ‘where applicable, a statement indicating, together with the
related revenues, that the undertaking is active in:
(i) the fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas) sector, (i.e. it derives revenues from exploration, mining,
extraction, production, processing, storage, refining or distribution, including
transportation, storage and trade, of fossil fuels as defined in Article 2, point (62), of
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council), including a
disaggregation of revenues derived from coal, from oil and from gas, as well as the
revenues derived from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities related to fossil gas as
required under Article 8(7)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 …’.
Annex II defines ‘fossil fuel’ as non-renewable carbon-based energy sources such as solid fuels,
natural gas and oil. This definition corresponds to Article 2, point (62), of Regulation (EU)
2018/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council.
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 defines ‘companies active in the fossil fuel
sector’ as companies that derive any revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, production,
processing, storage, refining or distribution, including transportation, storge and trade of fossil
fuels as defined in Article 2, point (62), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament
and the Council.
Answer
Whether the undertaking is active in the fossil fuel sector is based on ESRS 2 paragraph 40 (d)(i).
Fossil fuels are understood as non-renewable carbon-based energy sources such as solid fuels,
natural gas and oil.
(1) Is petrochemical sector included, like ethylene production? Many industrial sectors are
using products derived from oil or LNG as an input in the production of a chemical product.
Will they all be part of the fossil fuel sector? What are the limits?
The petrochemical activities, such as ethylene production, can be understood as a part of the
fossil fuel sector provided that they fulfil the definition of (EU) 2022/1288, as for example the
ethylene production that occurs in refinery cracker to produce gasoline. Ethylene production in a
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 100 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
cracker dedicated to producing ethylene and other petroleum gases as feedstocks for a chemical
plant or chemical industrial park, where these serve as intermediates for producing polymers and
industrial chemicals rather than being used as an energy source, would not be understood as a
part of the fossil fuel sector so long as it does not fulfil the definition of (EU) 2022/1288.
(2) Should an Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor of an LNG plant include its
EPC revenues under this caption?
An EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contractor of an LNG plant providing
services such as the ones described in NACE 71.12 ‘Engineering activities and related technical
consultancy’ or NACE division 42 ‘Civil engineering’, which includes construction of industrial
facilities, e.g. refineries, is considered active in fossil fuels sector provided that it derives any
revenues from the activities described in the definition of (EU) 2022/1288.

Background
According to ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (h), the undertaking shall disclose a specification of those

those covered by the undertaking using additional entity-specific disclosures.
Answer
ESRS 1 chapter 1.1 describes the three categories of ESRS standards (i.e., cross-cutting, topical and
sector-specific). ESRS 1 paragraph 11 explains the entity-specific disclosures that complement the
disclosures laid out in these three categories of ESRS standards.
In addition, ESRS 1 paragraphs AR1 to AR5 provide further guidance on the requirements that
entity-specific disclosures shall fulfil.
ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (h) requires undertakings to separately distinguish those material impacts,
risks and opportunities whose disclosures follow the ESRS standards (i.e., standardised
disclosures) from those that have been specifically designed by the undertaking according to the
provision in ESRS 1 paragraph 11 and its related Application Requirements (i.e., entity-specific

Question asked
What is the difference between current financial effects in ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (d) and anticipated
short-term effects in ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (e)?
ESRS Reference
ESRS 2 paragraph 48
Key terms
Financial effects; current financial effects; anticipated financial effects
Background
The submitter provided the following background for the question: ‘According to ESRS 1
Section 6.4 paragraph 77, the short-term time horizon is defined as the reporting period
(which we interpret as the current reporting period), and the medium-term horizon starts
after that reporting period up to five years. Is the next annual reporting period included in the
short-term horizon as defined by ESRS 1.77.b, and is that then the definition of anticipated
short-term effects, or is it included in the medium-term horizon? What would be the short-
term anticipated effects in that case? (In the French translation, short-term time horizon is
defined as the ‘période de référence’, which in paragraph 75 is the equivalent of the ‘base
year’ – this adds to the confusion.)’
ESRS 2 paragraph 48 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose …
(d) the current financial effects of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities on its
financial position, financial performance and cash flows and the material risks and
opportunities for which there is a significant risk of a material adjustment within the next
annual reporting period to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the
related financial statements; and
(e) the anticipated financial effects of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities on
its financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short-, medium- and
long-term, including the reasonably expected time horizons for those effects. This shall
include how the undertaking expects its financial position, financial performance and cash
flows to change over the short-, medium- and long-term, given its strategy to manage
risks and opportunities, taking into consideration:
(i) its investment and disposal plans (for example, capital expenditure, major
acquisitions and divestments, joint ventures, business transformation,
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 103 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
innovation, new business areas and asset retirements), including plans the
undertaking is not contractually committed to; and
(ii) its planned sources of funding to implement its strategy. …’.
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines:
(a) ‘financial effects’ as ‘Effects from risks and opportunities that affect the undertaking’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short-, medium- or long-
term’;
(b) ‘current financial effects’ as ‘Financial effects for the current reporting period that are
recognised in the primary financial statements’; and
(c) ‘anticipated financial effects’ as ‘Financial effects that do not meet the recognition criteria
for inclusion in the financial statement line items in the reporting period and that are not
captured by the current financial effects’.
ESRS 1 Appendix C states in its phase-in provisions regarding ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (e), ‘The
undertaking may omit the information prescribed by ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48 (e) (anticipated
financial effects) for the first year of preparation of its sustainability statement. The undertaking
may comply with ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48 (e) by reporting only qualitative disclosures for the
first three years of preparation of its sustainability statement, if it is impracticable to prepare
quantitative disclosures.’
Answer
Current financial effects and anticipated financial effects are two different concepts.
Current financial effects are defined as ‘financial effects for the current reporting period that are
recognised in the primary financial statements’. Anticipated financial effects are defined as
‘financial effects that do not meet the recognition criteria for inclusion in the financial statement
line items in the reporting period and that are not captured by the current financial effects’.
Anticipated financial effects includes the financial effects that are not ‘current financial effects’.
The distinguishing characteristic is whether the financial effect has already been recognised in the
financial statements based on the recognition criteria for inclusion in the primary financial
statements or not. Accordingly, the current financial effect has already been recognised at or
before the reporting date, whereas the anticipated effect might occur thereafter, be it in the short-
(within the reporting period, after the balance-sheet date), medium- or long-term.
For example, an impairment charge recognised in the current reporting period in accordance with
IAS 36 Impairment of assets is a current financial effect whereas a disclosure in accordance with
IAS 36 paragraph 134 (f), requiring the disclosure of a potential impairment based on a
‘reasonable possible change in key assumptions’, is an anticipated financial effect.
The second part of ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (d) (second datapoint) requires the disclosure of ‘… the
material risks and opportunities for which there is a significant risk of a material adjustment within
the next annual reporting period to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the
related financial statements’. This datapoint does not qualify as current financial effects but as
anticipated financial effects for which there is a significant risk of a material adjustment within
the next annual reporting period.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 104 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
In this sense, there is an overlap as the datapoint ‘adjustment within the next annual reporting
period’ is also part of the anticipated financial effects to be reported under ESRS 2 paragraph
48 (e).
The undertaking may incorporate disclosures using cross-references to the respective parts in the
financial statements to avoid repetitions. As a reminder in the context of financial effects,
undertakings shall include in their sustainability statement, based on thresholds of materiality,
references to the financial statements for monetary amounts or other quantitative data (see ESRS
1 paragraphs 124 and 125) – respectively, for significant data, assumptions, and qualitative
information (see ESRS 1 paragraphs 126 to 128 and Chapter 9.2 Connected information and
connectivity with financial statements). Incorporation by reference may be considered (see ESRS
1 Chapter 9.1 Incorporation by reference).

materiality;
(c) an overview of the process used to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor risks and

(ii) how the undertaking assesses the likelihood, magnitude and nature of effects of
the identified risks and opportunities (such as the qualitative or quantitative
thresholds and other criteria used as prescribed by ESRS 1 section 3.3 Financial
materiality) …’
ESRS 2 paragraph 59 states: ‘The undertaking shall provide an explanation of how it has
determined the material information to be disclosed in relation to the impacts, risks and
opportunities that it has assessed to be material, including the use of thresholds and/or how it
has implemented the criteria in ESRS 1 section 3.2 Material matters and materiality of
information.’
Answer
(1) How is threshold-setting to be documented?
ESRS do not set behavioural requirements. As explained in IG 1 Materiality Assessment FAQ 12
Should the materiality assessment be documented/evidenced? the ESRS do not prescribe specific
documentation. However, it is reasonable to expect that a certain level of documentation will
need to be produced. This will probably be used for internal control purposes and requested by
the assurance providers of the undertaking’s sustainability statement.
(2) How is one to disclose on threshold-setting? Is it enough to just generally explain how
the thresholds for the materiality assessment are set, or is it necessary to explain each
threshold separately?
Disclosing or explaining each threshold separately is not required in all circumstances. ESRS 2
requires disclosing an overview of the process to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor:
(a) impacts … including an explanation of whether and how the process … determines which
sustainability matters are material … including the qualitative or quantitative thresholds
and other criteria … and
(b) risks and opportunities … including how the undertaking assesses … risks and
opportunities such as the qualitative or quantitative thresholds and other criteria …’
Depending on its specific facts and circumstances, the description and disclosure of thresholds
may be more or less granular. Information about thresholds, as well as information about the
materiality process in general and its components, may be aggregated when this is compatible
with paragraphs 54 to 57 of ESRS 1.

ESRS 2 IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s
sustainability statement
Question ID 335 - Applicability of EU data points – Appendix B
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
Are ESRS 2 Appendix B datapoints (other EU legislation) applicable for all undertakings or for
financial institutions only?
ESRS reference
ESRS 2 Appendix B; ESRS 1 chapter 10.2, paragraphs 35 and 133
Key terms
ESRS 2 Appendix B (other EU legislation); EU data-points
Background
The question initially received by EFRAG from the submitter was referring to ESRS 1 chapter 10.2
paragraph 133 and read as follows: ‘What is the rationale for making the exception to the
transitional provision for datapoints that have their origin in certain EU legislation (Appendix B of
ESRS 2) applying to a very specific set of companies (e.g., financial institutions)? Why not make a
separate list of datapoint exceptions with an explanation of why these datapoints are an
exception?’ As similar questions related to ‘other EU legislation datapoints’ have been received
by EFRAG, the question answered in this explanation was modified to be more generally
applicable as stated above.
ESRS 1 paragraph 133 states: ‘For the first 3 years of its sustainability reporting under the ESRS, in
order to take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in gathering information
from actors throughout their value chain and in order to limit the burden for SMEs in the value
chain: …
(b) when disclosing metrics, the undertaking is not required to include upstream and
downstream value chain information, except for datapoints derived from other EU
legislation, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B.’
ESRS 2 Appendix B includes the list of datapoints in cross-cutting and topical standards that derive
from other EU legislation. These datapoints provide information from all undertakings subject to
ESRS for financial institutions to support them in financing the transition according to the ‘green
deal.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 35 states: ‘If the undertaking omits the information prescribed by a datapoint
that derives from other EU legislation listed in Appendix B of ESRS 2, it shall explicitly state that
the information in question is “not material”.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 107 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS 2 paragraph 56 states: ‘The undertaking shall also include a table of all the datapoints that
derive from other EU legislation as listed in Appendix B of this standard, indicating where they can
be found in the sustainability statement and including those that the undertaking has assessed as
not material, in which case the undertaking shall indicate “Not material” in the table in accordance
with ESRS 1 paragraph 35.’
Answer
Yes, ESRS 2 Appendix B datapoints (other EU legislation) are applicable for all undertakings in the
scope of the CSRD/ESRS.
ESRS do not specify that datapoints listed in Appendix B of ESRS 2 are exclusively applicable to
undertakings in specific sectors, such as financial institutions. This is because these datapoints
provide information from all ESRS-reporters enabling financial institutions to meet their
obligations under the SFDR, thereby assisting them in financing the transition in alignment with
the EU Green Deal, as they are designed to support the availability of information regarding their
investees and clients.
Datapoints that derive from other EU legislation listed in Appendix B of ESRS 2 must be provided
irrespective of the materiality assessment if the corresponding requirement is in ESRS 2 (e.g., ESRS
2 Disclosure Requirement GOV-1, Board gender diversity). If the corresponding requirement is in
the topical standards, they are subject to the materiality assessment.
In all cases, the undertaking should publish a table containing all the information required by other
EU legislations, specifying the page of the sustainability statement where this information is
located or indicating ‘not material’ if the company has deemed it as such, as required by ESRS 2
Disclosure Requirement IRO-2.

ESRS 2 paragraph 56 states: ‘The undertaking shall include a list of the Disclosure Requirements
complied with in preparing the sustainability statement following the outcome of the materiality
assessment (see ESRS 1 chapter 3), including the page numbers and/or paragraphs where the
related disclosures are located in the sustainability statement. This may be presented as a content
index. The undertaking shall also include a table of all the datapoints that derive from other EU
legislation as listed in Appendix B of this Standard, indicating where they can be found in the
sustainability statement and including those that the undertaking has assessed as not material,
in which case the undertaking shall indicate “not material” in the table in accordance with ESRS 1
paragraph 35.’
Answer
The undertaking shall include:
(a) a list of the Disclosure Requirements complied with, including the page numbers and/or
paragraphs where the related disclosures are in the sustainability statement (ESRS 2
paragraph 56). This may be presented as a content index;
(b) a table of all the datapoints that derive from other EU legislation as listed in ESRS 2
Appendix B, indicating where they can be found in the sustainability statement and those
that the undertaking has assessed as not material, in which case the undertaking shall
indicate “not material” in the table in accordance with ESRS 1 paragraph 35.
There is no predefined format for this disclosure or for the content index. To structure the
sustainability statement, inspiration can be drawn from the digital ESRS XBRL Taxonomy.

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 109 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
MDR-Actions; resources allocated
Background
ESRS 2 paragraph 66 states: ‘The undertaking shall apply the requirements for the content of
disclosures in this provision when it describes the actions through which it manages each material
sustainability matter, including action plans and resources allocated and/or planned.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 69 states: ‘Where the implementation of an action plan requires significant
operational expenditures (Opex) and/or capital expenditures (Capex), the undertaking shall:
(a) describe the type of current and future financial and other resources allocated to the
action plan, including, if applicable, the relevant terms of sustainable finance instruments,
such as green bonds, social bonds and green loans, the environmental or social objectives,
and whether the ability to implement the actions or action plan depends on specific
preconditions, e.g. granting of financial support or public policy and market
developments;
(b) provide the amount of current financial resources and explain how they relate to the most
relevant amounts presented in the financial statements; and
(c) provide the amount of future financial resources.’
ESRS 2 paragraph AR 23 states: ‘Information on resource allocation may be presented in the form
of a table and broken down between capital expenditure and operating expenditure, and across
the relevant time horizons, and between resources applied in the current reporting year and the
planned allocation of resources over specific time horizons.’
ESRS S1-S4 (e.g. ESRS S1 paragraph AR 48) state: ‘When disclosing the resources allocated to the
management of material impacts, the undertaking may explain which internal functions are
involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and
advance positive impacts.’
Because ESRS E1-E5, S1-S4 have numerous other references to ‘resources allocated’ when
requiring disclosures, they are not replicated in this background section (see the ESRS reference
section).
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘marine resources’ and ‘natural resources’.
Answer
The amount of current and future financial resources shall be disclosed where the implementation
of an action plan requires significant operational expenditures (Opex) and/or capital expenditures
(Capex). The ‘departments or specific teams in charge’, on the other hand, may be disclosed.
The ESRS 2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) on actions and resources (ESRS 2
paragraphs 66 to 69) are to be applied together with the Disclosure Requirements, including the
Application Requirements, provided in the relevant topical ESRS.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 110 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
The term ‘resources allocated’ is not specifically defined in ESRS. Based on ESRS 2 paragraph 69,
‘resources allocated’ relates to significant Opex and Capex in terms of ‘financial and other
resources’. Again, whilst ‘other resources’ is not defined, it can still be assumed that human
resources are one major element of ‘other resources’.
The term ‘total budget allocated’ is not used in ESRS. However, the amount of current and future
financial resources shall be disclosed by the undertaking in accordance with ESRS 2 paragraph 69
(b) and (c) when the implementation of an action plan requires significant Opex and/or Capex.
The undertaking may disclose the internal functions involved in managing material impacts in
accordance with ESRS S1-S4 (e.g. ESRS S1 paragraph AR 48); this might include the ‘departments
or specific teams in charge’ when disclosing resources allocated to the management of material
impacts. There is no equivalent voluntary Disclosure Requirement in ESRS E1 to E5.
To note: regarding Minimum Disclosure Requirements on policies (ESRS 2 paragraph 65), ‘The
undertaking shall disclose information about policies adopted to manage material sustainability
matters. This information shall include:
(a) the most senior level in the undertaking’s organisation that is accountable for the
implementation of a policy …’.

Answer
Yes, if a company’s metric is verified by an EU Ecolabel, and assuming that the Ecolabel is not an
internal body of the undertaking, the Ecolabel can be mentioned as an external body.
According to ESRS 2 paragraph 77 (b), the undertaking is required to disclose whether the
measurement of the metric is validated by an external body other than the assurance provider
and to specify which body.

Is MDR-Policy a prerequisite for MDR-Target?
ESRS Reference
Definition of ‘targets’ and ‘policies’ in Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms; ESRS 2 paragraphs

Key terms
Targets; policies
Background
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘targets’ as: ‘Measurable, outcome-oriented and
time-bound goals that the undertaking aims to achieve in relation to material impacts, risks or
opportunities. They may be set voluntarily by the undertaking or derive from legal requirements
on the undertaking.’
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘policies’ as: ‘A set or framework of general
objectives and management principles that the undertaking uses for decision-making. A policy
implements the undertaking’s strategy or management decisions related to a material
sustainability matter. Each policy is under the responsibility of defined person(s), specifies its
perimeter of application, and includes one or more objectives (linked when applicable to
measurable targets). A policy is validated and reviewed following the undertakings’ applicable
governance rules. A policy is implemented through actions or action plans.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 112 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS 2 paragraphs 78 to 80 state:
‘78. The undertaking shall apply the requirements for the content of disclosures in this provision
when it discloses information about the targets it has set with regard to each material
sustainability matter.
79. The objective of this Minimum Disclosure Requirement is to provide for each material
sustainability matter an understanding of:
(a) whether and how the undertaking tracks the effectiveness of its actions to address
material impacts, risks and opportunities, including the metrics it uses to do so;
(b) measurable time-bound outcome-oriented targets set by the undertaking to meet the
policy’s objectives, defined in terms of expected results for people, the environment or
the undertaking regarding material impacts, risks and opportunities;
(c) the overall progress towards the adopted targets over time;
(d) in the case that the undertaking has not set measurable time-bound outcome-oriented
targets, whether and how it nevertheless tracks the effectiveness of its actions to
address material impacts, risks and opportunities and measures the progress in
achieving its policy objectives; and
(e) whether and how stakeholders have been involved in target setting for each material
sustainability matter.
80. The undertaking shall disclose the measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets
on material sustainability matters it has set to assess progress. For each target, the disclosure
shall include the following information …’.
Answer
The Minimum Disclosure Requirement – Policies MDR-P of ESRS 2 Chapter 4.2 is not a prerequisite
for the Minimum Disclosure Requirement – Targets of ESRS 2 Chapter 5.
ESRS stipulate disclosures but do not prescribe behaviour. Therefore, they do not prescribe for
each target set, which the undertaking also has a policy in place for how to reach. Accordingly, an
undertaking might have a target without establishing a policy on how to get there. However, this
may not be efficient: while a target can be set without a policy, there is no clear management
principle, rule or guidance on how to achieve it, making it unlikely to be met.
If the undertaking has a target without a related policy, the description of the relationship of the
target to the policy objectives as required by ESRS 2 paragraph 80 (a) shall make that clear.
To note: Minimum Disclosure Requirements – Actions MDR-A – Actions and resources in relation
to material sustainability matters also mentions the situation when actions are implemented
without a specific policy (see ESRS 2 paragraph 68).

ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 b(ii), and 20 c(ii)
Key Terms
Gross risk; physical risk; transition risk
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 20 b(ii) states: ‘The undertaking shall describe the process to identify and
assess climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities. This description shall include its process
in relation to: …
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 114 of 278

(c) climate-related transition risks and opportunities in own operations and along the
upstream and downstream value chain, in particular: …
ii. the assessment of how its assets and business activities may be exposed to these
climate-related transition events, creating gross transition risks or opportunities
for the undertaking.’
ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 details the processes to identify and assess climate-related
impacts, risks and opportunities. It requires the assessment of gross material risks. This process
allows to respond to ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement SBM-3, which introduces the description of
business resilience in relation to climate change. The actions and resources to mitigate material
risks will lead to residual net risks. The climate risk and scenario analysis/assessments processes
should be done on a gross basis.
Answer
As stated in ESRS E1 paragraph 20, the undertaking shall describe the process to identify and
assess climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities. This assessment refers to gross physical
and transition risks. Gross risks means that the undertaking should not consider the effects of the
actions and resources to mitigate the material risk when assessing it.
When disclosing the information required under ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 (b) and 20 (c), the
undertaking shall explain how it has used climate-related scenario analysis, including a range of
climate scenarios, to inform the identification and assessment of physical risks and transition risks
and opportunities over the short-, medium- and long-term.
The assessment of material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities is performed looking
at the gross risk, i.e., before any mitigating actions. The same applies to scenario analysis when it
is used to support the identification and materiality assessment of impacts, risks and
opportunities.
When disclosing according to ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 b(ii) and c(ii), consideration should be given
to ESRS 1 paragraph 31 that relevant information is disclosed only on the material risks.

Question asked
Is it an absolute requirement in paragraph 30 that 90-95% of GHG emission reduction needs to be
performed before giving the option to work with GHG Removals?
Key Terms
GHG removal, GHG emission reduction
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 30, 34 and 60; Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms: GHG removal and
storage, and Carbon credit
Background
ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-4 refers to ‘Targets related to climate change mitigation and
adaptation’.
ESRS E1 paragraph 34 (b) states: ‘GHG emission reduction targets shall be disclosed for Scope 1,
2, and 3 GHG emissions, either separately or combined. The undertaking shall specify, in case of
combined GHG emission reduction targets, which GHG emission Scopes (1, 2 and/or 3) are
covered by the target, the share related to each respective GHG emission Scope and which GHGs
are covered. The undertaking shall explain how the consistency of these targets with its GHG
inventory boundaries is ensured (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-6). The GHG emission
reduction targets shall be gross targets, meaning that the undertaking shall not include GHG
removals, carbon credits or avoided emissions as a means of achieving the GHG emission
reduction targets;’
ESRS E1 paragraph 60 states: ‘In the case where the undertaking discloses a net-zero target in
addition to the gross GHG emission reduction targets in accordance with Disclosure Requirement
E1-4, paragraph 30, it shall explain the scope, methodologies and frameworks applied and how
the residual GHG emissions (after approximately 90-95% of GHG emission reduction with the
possibility for justified sectoral variations in line with a recognised sectoral decarbonisation
pathway) are intended to be neutralised by, for example, GHG removals in its own operations and
upstream and downstream value chain.’
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms: ‘GHG removal and storage – (anthropogenic) removals
refer to the withdrawal of GHGs from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities.
These include enhancing biological anthropogenic sinks of CO2 and using chemical engineering to
achieve long-term removal and storage. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from industrial and
energy-related sources, which alone does not remove CO2 from the atmosphere, can remove
atmospheric CO2 if combined with bioenergy production (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture &
Storage – BECCS). Removals can be subject to reversals, which are movements of stored GHG out
of the intended storage that re-enter the atmosphere. For example, if a forest that was grown to
remove a specific amount of CO2 is subject to a wildfire, the emissions captured in the trees are
reversed.’
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms: ‘Carbon credit – A transferable or tradable instrument
that represents one metric tonne of CO2eq emission reduction or removal issued and verified
according to recognised quality standards.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 116 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
ESRS E1 does not mandate undertakings to work, or prevent them from working, with GHG
removals. While the (extent of) use of carbon removals remains the undertaking’s decision, ESRS
E1 aims at ensuring transparency. It requires to differentiate between:
(a) the established GHG emissions reduction targets (that shall not include carbon removals
per ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-4);
(b) targets related to net-zero (ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-7 paragraph 60, which
requires GHG emission reductions of approximately 90-95%); and
(c) the climate neutrality claims involving carbon credits (ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-
7 paragraph 61).
Undertakings can work with GHG removals before achieving 90-95% GHG emission reductions
near the point of net-zero. If they claim to have set a net-zero target, however, they need to explain
how they expect to neutralise the outstanding residual emissions after a 90-95% of GHG emissions
reduction has been achieved.
Question ID 531 – Base year
Release date

Question asked
If the company has an intensity-emission-reduction target already set with a different base year
than the ESRS recommend (e.g. 2021) but no absolute target yet, is it okay to use the same base
year as for the intensity target although it does not follow the ESRS recommendation?
Reference
ESRS E1 paragraph 34(c)(d) and AR 25
Key terms
Base year; intensity-emission target
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 34 states: ‘If the undertaking has set GHG emission reduction targets, ESRS 2
MDR-T and the following requirements shall apply: …
(c) the undertaking shall disclose its current base year and baseline value, and from 2030
onwards, update the base year for its GHG emission reduction targets after every five-
year period thereafter. The undertaking may disclose the past progress made in meeting
its targets before its current base year provided that this information is consistent with
the requirements of this Standard;
(d) GHG emission reduction targets shall at least include target values for the year 2030
and, if available, for the year 2050. From 2030, target values shall be set after every five-
year period thereafter …’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 117 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 25 states: ‘When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34(c)
on base year and baseline value: …
(b) the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in
either the target or reporting boundary occur. In such a case, the undertaking shall
explain how the new baseline value affects the new target, its achievement and
presentation of progress over time. To foster comparability, when setting new targets,
the undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting
year of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the target
year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be selected from
the period between 2022 and 2025 …’
Answer
The following situations might arise.
(a) The undertaking has no target.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 25 (b) does not set a recommendation but a methodological (application)
requirement to set a new target for the base year ‘… that does not precede the first reporting year
of the new target period by longer than three years.’. In other words, the base year must be one
of the last three years in which the undertaking has reliably measured its GHG emissions while
undertaking decarbonization actions.
GHG emission reduction targets shall at least include target values for the year 2030 (ESRS E1
paragraph 34 (d)). For example, for 2030 as the target year and a target period between 2025 and
2030, the base year shall be selected from the period between 2022 and 2025. In accordance with
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 25, to set a target with a baseline figure in 2021, the target would have to
cover the period of 2024 to 2030, with 2024 being the first year for reporting on the new target.
For undertakings with a reduction plan in progress at the time the CSRD comes into force, there
is no need to modify the targets if they meet the requirement of ESRS E1. The plans will be revised
and aligned with 2023 (reporting year) once the reduction period is over.
(b) The undertaking already has a target.
If an undertaking already has GHG emission reduction targets in place which have been publicly
disclosed, these should not be updated for the purposes of CSRD requirements. The target level
and base year can remain unchanged until the target is required to be updated, e.g. due to
significant changes in scope or after 2030. Information on these targets should be reported in line
with CSRD requirements. For its GHG emission reduction target, the undertaking shall disclose in
absolute value the GHG emission reduction target and its current target base year and target
baseline value. If an undertaking’s pre-existing targets are intensity targets, the CSRD
requirements do not require a new absolute target to be set. Rather, they require for each
intensity target an associated absolute target value to be disclosed. This associated absolute value
would be based on the intensity target reduction specified for the pre-existing target.
(c) Case of early achievement.
If an undertaking achieves its target (past target period) earlier than expected, the base year may
be older provided that this old base year meets the ESRS E1-4 requirements.
This question will also be covered in the Implementation Guidance Transition plan being
developed by EFRAG.

their new base year to the actual emissions of the new base year and therefore suggest that the
past emissions have not been realised?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 34 (c) and AR 25 (d)
Key terms
Climate-related targets, progress
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 34 states: ‘If the undertaking has set GHG emission reduction targets, ESRS 2
MDR-T and the following requirements shall apply …
(c) the undertaking shall disclose its current base year and baseline value, and from 2030
onwards, update the base year for its GHG emission reduction targets after every five-
year period thereafter. The undertaking may disclose the past progress made in meeting
its targets before its current base year provided that this information is consistent with
the requirements of this Standard …’.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 25 states: ‘When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34(c)
on base year and baseline value: …
(d) when presenting climate-related targets, the undertaking may disclose the progress in
meeting these targets made before its current base year. In doing so, the undertaking
shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the information on past progress is
consistent with the requirements of this Standard. In the case of methodological
differences, for example, regarding target boundaries, the undertaking shall provide a
brief explanation for these differences.’
Answer
No, an undertaking cannot add the amount of emissions reduced before its new base year to the
actual emissions of the new base year and therefore suggest that the past emissions have not
been realised.
While undertakings may disclose the progress done in meeting these targets before their current
base year, when doing it undertakings may disclose quantitative and qualitative information, e.g.
disclosure of the amount of the emissions reduced, an explanation in case of methodological
differences, an explanation of the alignment with the requirements of the E1 Standard, etc.

However, it is not allowed to add previous emission reductions achieved to the new base year
emissions, which shall be the ones effectively disclosed under the ESRS for the new base year
(with no additions or subtractions).
It is important to note that, even if an undertaking cannot add the amount of emissions reduced
before its new base year, this reduction might have an impact on the future targets set by the
undertaking as it is linked to the sector emission reduction path.
For example, assuming that the current (new) base year is 2025, the amount of reductions in Y-1
(i.e. 2024) cannot be added to the 2025 base year as displayed in the following table.

Background
ESRS E1 paragraphs 35 to 37 state:
‘35. The undertaking shall provide information on its energy consumption and mix.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 120 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
36. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an understanding of the
undertaking’s total energy consumption in absolute value, improvement in energy efficiency,
exposure to coal, oil and gas-related activities, and the share of renewable energy in its overall
energy mix.
37. The disclosure required by ESRS E1 paragraph 35 shall include the total energy consumption
in MWh related to own operations disaggregated by
(a) total energy consumption from fossil sources;
(b) total energy consumption from nuclear sources; and
(c) total energy consumption from renewable sources disaggregated by
i. fuel consumption for renewable sources, including biomass (also comprising industrial
and municipal waste of biologic origin), biofuels, biogas, hydrogen from renewable
sources, etc. …’
ESRS 2 MDR-M paragraph 77 requires the undertakings to disclose the significant assumptions
behind the metric, including the limitations of the methodologies used.
Answer
ESRS E1 paragraph 37 (b) requires the disclosure of total energy consumption from nuclear
sources.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR32 (d) clarifies that the energy to be reported should refer to ‘final energy
consumption’, which includes energy carriers such as electricity, heat and steam that can be and
are frequently derived from nuclear sources.
An undertaking disclosing on the basis of ESRS 1 paragraph 35 should thus report the final energy
consumption taking into account its energy mix, which may involve proportions of nuclear-
generated electricity, heat, steam, and cooling; fossil-fuel generated electricity, heat, steam,
cooling and fuels; or renewable electricity, heat, steam, cooling and fuels.
This disclosure requires the undertaking to understand from its consumption of electricity which
portions originate from nuclear, fossil or renewables sources. When electricity, heat and steam
are purchased and the mix includes fractions of nuclear-generated electricity, heat, and steam,
these fractions are to be included in the disclosures under ESRS E1 paragraph 37 (b) on total
energy consumption from nuclear sources. The undertaking should use the information available
on the electricity, heat and steam mix to reflect its energy consumption breakdown according to
ESRS E1 paragraph 35 accurately.

Key terms
Impact sectors
Background
ESRS E1 mentions the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 Annex I(9) when
referring to the definition of ‘high-climate sectors’.
According to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 Annex I(9), ‘high-impact climate
sectors’ means the sectors listed in Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No
1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ESRS E1 paragraph 38 states that the undertaking with operations in high-climate impact sectors
shall further disaggregate their total energy consumption from fossil sources by:
(a) fuel consumption from coal and coal products;
(b) fuel consumption from crude oil and petroleum products;
(c) fuel consumption from natural gas;
(d) fuel consumption from other fossil sources; and
(e) consumption of purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam or cooling from fossil
sources.
ESRS E1 paragraph 40 states that the undertaking shall provide information on the energy
intensity (total energy consumption per net revenue) associated with activities in high-climate
impact sectors.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 36 (a) provides the calculation formula in which total energy consumption
from activities in high-climate impact sectors is in a numerator while net revenue from activities
in high-climate impact sectors is in a denominator. Moreover, point (c) of this AR clarifies that the
numerator and denominator shall only consist of the proportion of the total final energy
consumption (in the numerator) and net revenue (in the denominator) that are attributable to
activities in high-climate impact sectors. Finally, this point provides that, in effect, there should be
consistency in the scope of both the numerator and denominator.
Answer
According to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 Annex I(9), high-climate impact
sectors are those listed in NACE Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No
1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The list of targeted sections is the
following.
Section A: Agriculture, forestry and fishing (NACE division 01-03)
Section B: Mining and quarrying (NACE division 05-09)
Section C: Manufacturing (NACE division 10-33)

November 2024
Question asked
Which indicators are to be used to convert fossil fuels to kWh (gasoline, diesel, natural gas)?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 32
Key terms
Conversion factors; fossil fuels
Background
The submitter also asked about the ‘conversion of air conditioning refrigerants to kWh.’ As there
is no need to convert air conditioning refrigerants into energy units, this question is not addressed.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 32 states: ‘When preparing the information on energy consumption
required under paragraph 35, the undertaking shall: …
(d) ensure all quantitative energy-related information is reported in either Mega-
Watthours (MWh) in Lower Heating Value or net calorific value. If raw data of energy-
related information is only available in energy units other than MWh (such as Giga
Joules (GJ) or eritish Thermal Units (etu)), in volume units (such as cubic feet or gallons)
or in mass units (such as kilograms or pounds), they shall be converted to MWh using
suitable conversion factors (see, for example, Annex II of the Fifth Assessment IPCC
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 123 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
report). Conversion factors for fuels shall be made transparent and applied in a
consistent manner …’.
Answer
Conversion factors for the energy content of fuels (so-called ‘heating’ or ‘calorific values’) need to
be used when preparing information on energy consumption. Heating values can be direct or
indirect data, originate from multiple sources, and be expressed in different ways (e.g. energy per
weight or energy per volume).
Direct data on heating values will result from the analysis of the heat content of fuels used and
from which a conversation factor is derived. This is typically done by very large energy consumers
(and emitters) who need to know well the fuels they use, for example, power production from
fossil fuels.
Indirect data on heating values can comprise, for example, data from fuel suppliers, national
statistics data or engineering/technical factors representing usually accepted average figures for
each fuel type, often reported as ranges (e.g. biodiesel 39–41 MJ/kg).
Common sources of indirect data for heating values are:
(a) 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Table 1.2, page 1.18), also
used as a reference for Annex VI of the EU ETS Monitoring and reporting regulation;
(b) the UN Energy Statistics Yearbook, which provides statistical series of Heating values for
different fuels and countries (see the supplement to the 2021 Energy Statistics Database);
(c) GHG national inventories reports (NIR) submitted to the UNFCCC; and publications from
energy statistics by the national statistics or energy authorities.
(d) It is important to note that calorific value changes across jurisdictions.

What are the CSRD requirements regarding heating values (Lower Heating Value (LHV) versus
Higher Heating value (HHV)), and do they differ based on the location of the preparer?
ESRS Reference
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 32
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 124 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
Heating values; location; energy consumption
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 32 states that ‘when preparing the information on energy consumption
required under paragraph 35, the undertaking shall:
(a) only report energy consumed from processes owned or controlled by the undertaking
applying the same perimeter applied for reporting GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions;
(b) exclude feedstocks and fuels that are not combusted for energy purposes. The undertaking
that consumes fuel as feedstocks can disclose information on this consumption separately
from the required disclosures;
(c) ensure all quantitative energy-related information is reported in either Mega-Watt-hours
(MWh) in Lower Heating Value or net calorific value. If raw data of energy-related
information is only available in energy units other than MWh (such as Giga-Joules (GJ) or
British Thermal Units (Btu)), in volume units (such as cubic feet or gallons) or in mass units
(such as kilograms or pounds), they shall be converted to MWh using suitable conversion
factors (see for example Annex II of the Fifth Assessment IPCC report). Conversion factors
for fuels shall be made transparent and applied in a consistent manner’.
For further guidance on Heating Values, see the content below.
‘Most fuels are mixtures of carbon and hydrogen and these are the main heating agents. There
may be other elements which do not contribute, or contribute only slightly, to the calorific value
of the fuel. Both the carbon and the hydrogen combine with oxygen during combustion and the
reactions provide the heat. When the hydrogen combines with oxygen, it forms water in a gaseous
or vapour state at the high temperature of the combustion. The water is therefore almost always
carried away with the other products of combustion in the exhaust gases from the apparatus in
which the combustion takes place (boiler, engine, furnace, etc.).
When the exhaust gases cool, the water will condense into a liquid state and release heat known
as latent heat, which is wasted in the atmosphere. The heating value of a fuel may, therefore, be
expressed as a gross value or a net value. The gross value includes all of the heat released from
the fuel, including any carried away in the water formed during combustion. The net value
excludes the latent heat of the water formed during combustion. It is important when obtaining
a calorific value to check whether it is net or gross. The differences between net and gross are
typically about 5% to 6% of the gross value for solid and liquid fuels and about 10% for natural
gas.
There are a few fuels which contain no, or very little, hydrogen (for example blastfurnace gas,
high-temperature cokes and some petroleum cokes). In these cases, there will be negligible
differences between net and gross calorific values.
The derivation of net calorific values for solid fuels is further complicated because they often
contain water trapped within the fuel in addition to the water which will be formed from the
hydrogen they contain. The reduction in net calorific value as a result of the additional water is
uncertain because the dampness of the fuel may vary according to weather and storage
conditions.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 125 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
In summary, the net calorific value of a fuel is the total heat produced by burning it minus the
heat needed to evaporate the water present in the fuel or produced during its combustion. Major
users of solid fuels, such as power stations, should be able to provide net calorific values based
on the monitoring of the electricity generation’ (Source: IEA (2004), Energy Statistics Manual, IEA,
Paris, Licence: CC BY 4.0)
There are multiple sources of conversion expressions between HHV and LHV depending on the
fuels (coal, NG, biomass, etc.), which can also vary in origin and treatment of fuels in each region.
Undertakings are advised to search for appropriate conversion expressions for their particular
circumstances.
Answer
According to the ESRS E1 paragraph AR 32, the undertaking is required to disclose quantitative
energy-related information in Mega-Watt-hours (MWh) in Lower Heating Value (LHV) (or net
calorific value, NCV).
Undertakings that typically use Higher Heating Values (HHVs) (e.g. in certain locations, for certain
technologies and/or based on conventions related to energy carriers) must disclose using LHV or
net calorific value to comply with the ESRS, which may imply using fuel specific conversion
formulas between HHV and LHV.
Note: The LHV (or NCV) of a fuel is the total heat produced by burning it minus the heat needed
to evaporate the water present in the fuel or produced during its combustion (see more
information on heating values in the background).

Background
The original question submitted: ‘Should the companies of a holding company use the same
criteria and methodology for GHG emissions?’ has been reworded to the above question to be
clearer.
ESRS 1 Appendix B, qualitative characteristics of information shall be applied in the preparation
of the ESRS sustainability statement.
ESRS 2 paragraph 77 (a) states: ‘disclose the methodologies and significant assumptions behind
the metric, including the limitations of the methodologies used;’. ESRS E1 paragraph AR 39 (b)
requires the undertaking to: ‘disclose the methodologies, significant assumptions and emissions
factors used to calculate or measure GHG emissions accompanied by the reasons why they were
chosen, and provide a reference or link to any calculation tools used.’ Moreover, ESRS E1
paragraph AR46 (h), on Scope 3 emissions, requires clarity on the boundaries considered and the
methods used for estimating emissions: ‘for each significant Scope 3 GHG category, disclose the
reporting boundaries considered, the calculation methods for estimating the GHG emissions as
well as if and which calculation tools were applied. The Scope 3 categories should be consistent
with the GHGP and include:
(a) indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from the consolidated accounting group (the parent
and its subsidiaries),
(b) indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, and unconsolidated
subsidiaries for which the undertaking has the ability to control the operational
activities and relationships (i.e., operational control),
(c) Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated
subsidiaries (investment entities) and joint arrangements for which the undertaking
does not have operational control and when these entities are part of the undertaking’s
upstream and downstream value chain.’
All these requirements point to the advantages of using a uniform approach for ease of
understanding and transparency.
Answer
All subsidiaries and their parent undertaking shall apply the requirements of ESRS, including the
qualitative characteristics of information in ESRS 1 Appendix B. The GHG Protocol is the reference
for the calculation of GHG emissions following ESRS E1. The sustainability statement shall include
the methodology and the significant assumptions made by the parent and subsidiaries regarding
GHG emissions, as stated in ESRS E1 paragraph AR 39.
ESRS does not exclude flexibility in the methodologies used by different undertakings in the same
group, provided that the qualitative characteristics of information are met.
A standardised approach from the onset is advantageous for its consistency, comparability,
transparency and the overall integrity of reported GHG emissions.
Deviations from a common methodology can be accepted but should be disclosed, along with the
rationale for their use, to meet the transparency requirements set forth by the ESRS.

Key terms
Materiality assessment, materiality, relevance; scope 3 GHG emissions, insurance companies,
financial investment
Background
The determination of which categories of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions to include in the
sustainability statement is driven by the materiality assessment of the company, namely in the
scope of the analysis of ESRS 1 paragraph 31, which states that ‘The applicable information
prescribed within a Disclosure Requirement, including its datapoints, or an entity-specific
disclosure, shall be disclosed when the undertaking assesses, as part of its assessment of material
information, that the information is relevant from one or more of the following perspectives: (a)
the significance of the information in relation to the matter it purports to depict or explain; or (b)
the capacity of such information to meet the users’ decision-making needs, including the needs
of primary users of general-purpose financial reporting described in paragraph 48 and/or the
needs of users whose principal interest is in information about the undertaking’s impacts.’
If climate change is considered a material topic by the undertaking, insurance companies are
required by ESRS E1 paragraphs 44 and 51 to disclose their gross Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions for each of the Scope 3 categories that they assess to be ‘significant’, encompassing
emissions within their upstream and downstream value chain. This includes emissions over which
the company does not have direct control but that may have a significant impact on its overall
carbon footprint and transition risks, as outlined in ESRS E1 paragraph 45.
In making its evaluation of the ‘significant Scope 3 categories’, the company shall consider, in
accordance with ESRS E1 AR39 (a), the principles, requirements and guidance of the GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard. The GHG Protocol also includes a supplement ‘GHG protocol Corporate Value
Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard’ (also referred to in this document as ‘GHGP
Scope 3 standard’), which makes reference as well to the GHG Protocol ‘Technical Guidance for
calculating Scope 3 Emissions’ (v1.0), a supplement to the GHGP Scope 3 standard.

and Reporting Standard” and further articulated in “relevance criteria” by the “GHG protocol
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard”, as well as the “Technical
Guidance for calculating Scope 3 Emissions”.
The GHG Protocol Scope 3 Category 15 is specifically tailored to financial institutions – which
includes insurance undertakings – and the following financial investments and services are
required to be reported (under the GHG Scope 3 standard, Table 5.9, pp.52): equity investments,
debt investments and project finance.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 46 states that the financial institution shall consider the GHG Accounting
and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting
Financial (PCAF), specifically part A ‘Financed Emissions’ (version December 2022).
Answer
When reporting on their gross Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the undertaking discloses
the amounts corresponding to the Scope 3 categories that it considers significant. For
investments, this will factor in the scale of the investments and the associated indirect GHG
emissions. The company should follow the principles, requirements and guidance laid out in the
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, the GHGP Scope 3 standard as well as the associated Scope 3
calculation guidance. Moreover, as stated in ESRS E1 paragraph AR 46 (b), financial institutions
shall consider the GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry from the
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial (PCAF), specifically part A ‘Financed Emissions’

(c) gross Scope 3 GHG emission; and
(d) total GHG emission’.
ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirements E1-6 – Gross Scopes 1,2,3 and Total GHG emission give some
details on the calculation guidance for GHG emission. ESRS E1 paragraph AR39 states that ‘the
undertaking shall consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG
Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004). The undertaking may consider the Commission
Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064-1:2018 …’
CO2e is a unit used in GHG accounting that reflects the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission
that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change over a given time
horizon as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs. To calculate
emissions in CO2e, the different Global Warming Potential (GWP) of GHGs should be used. GWPs
are used to evaluate releasing (or avoid releasing) different greenhouse gases on a common basis
– commonly, one tonne of CO2. As per ESRS E1 paragraph AR39, when reporting emissions the
undertaking shall ‘use the most recent Global Warming Potential (GWP) values published by the
IPCC based on a 100-year time horizon to calculate CO2eq emissions of non-CO2 gases’.
Answer
(1) How can GHG emissions be calculated and what methodologies can be used?
The undertaking shall consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG
Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004). The undertaking may consider Commission
Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064-1:2018. This
gives further details on GHG emission calculation guidance.
If further support is needed, the GHG Protocol website also provides further guidance, calculation
tools and online training on GHG accounting.
It is to be noted that ESRS are specifying some of the applications of the GHG protocol, in
particular in respect of operational control (see ESRS E1 paragraphs 46 and 50).
(2) What exactly are the CO2 equivalents used for the calculation?
When expressing its GHG emissions, the preparer shall make it in units of Tco2e, using the latest
Global Warming Potential (GWP) values published by the IPCC based on a 100-year time horizon.
CO2eq is the universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential (GWP) of
each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 131 of 278

evaluate releasing different greenhouse gases on a common basis. GWP is a factor describing the
radiative forcing impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG relative
to one unit of CO2. The current list is the one in the IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report, Chapter 7SM3.

Users of information should be able to understand how the GHG inventory figures have been
determined. For these purposes, it may be sufficient to refer to the sources of emission factors
(EF) without providing the actual figures – which could result in too detailed a reporting and
potentially obscure the relevant information. Alternatively, where the EF is a key determinant of
a significant reported figure, it may be useful to disclose the actual values of an emission factor. It
is up to the preparer to make the determination of when it is most appropriate to disclose just
the source of EFs or to disclose the EF value.

Key Terms
GHG emission; annual update
Background
The original question submitted is the following: ‘GHG Emission Gross – scope 1-3— I would like
to know if corporates need to update and disclose their GHG emissions each year to comply with
the CSRD reporting.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 30 provides that when the undertaking concludes that a sustainability matter
is material ‘… it shall: (a) disclose information according to the Disclosure Requirements (including
Application Requirements) related to that specific sustainability matter in the corresponding
topical ESRS …’. ESRS 1 paragraph 73 states: ‘The reporting period for the undertaking’s
sustainability statement shall be consistent with that of its financial statements.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 132 states: ‘For the first three years of the undertaking’s sustainability reporting
under the ESRS, in the event that not all the necessary information regarding its upstream and
downstream value chain is available, the undertaking shall explain the efforts made to obtain the
necessary information about its upstream and downstream value chain, the reasons why not all
of the necessary information could be obtained, and its plans to obtain the necessary information
in the future.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 133 states: ‘For the first three years of its sustainability reporting under the
ESRS …
(b) when disclosing metrics, the undertaking is not required to include upstream and
downstream value chain information, except for datapoints derived from other EU
legislation, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B.’
This appendix includes Scope 1-3 and total emissions.
ESRS 1 Appendix C: List of phased-in Disclosure Requirements includes reference to E1-6
Disclosure Requirement, indicating that undertakings or groups not exceeding on their balance
sheet dates the average number of 750 employees during the financial year (on a consolidated
basis where applicable) may omit the datapoints on Scope 3 emissions and total GHG emissions
for the first year of preparation of their sustainability statement.
ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-6 paragraph 44 requires the undertaking to disclose its gross
Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 and total GHG emissions. With respect to the Scope 3, ESRS E1
paragraph AR 46 (f) requires updating Scope 3 GHG emissions in each significant category every
year on the basis of current activity data and updating the full Scope 3 GHG inventory at least
every three years or on the occurrence of a significant event or significant change in the
circumstances.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 133 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
An undertaking shall disclose and update their Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions on
an annual basis (consistent with financial statements, as per ESRS 1 paragraph 73) and in
accordance with the provisions of ESRS 1 and ESRS E1-6.
With regard to Scope 3 GHG emissions more specifically, the update of Scope 3 GHG emissions in
each significant category shall occur every year on the basis of current activity data; the update
of the full Scope 3 GHG inventory is required at least every three years or on the occurrence of a
significant event or a significant change in circumstances (see ESRS E1 paragraph AR 46 (f)).

July 2024
Question asked
Should ESRS E1 paragraph AR 48 including the table for disaggregating total emissions be
interpreted as a mandate that all disclosers use the given table (as suggested using ‘shall’)? If so,
could the meaning of the columns be more clearly specified?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 48
Key terms
Total emissions
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 48 states that the undertaking shall disclose its total GHG emissions
disaggregated by Scopes 1 and 2 and significant Scope 3 in accordance with the table below.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 134 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
The retrospective columns concern historical data. The base year is the historical reference date
or period for which information is available and against which subsequent information can be
compared over time, as stated in ESRS 1 Chapter 6.3 Reporting progress against the base year.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 135 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 25 requires that when setting new targets the undertaking select a recent
base year that does not precede the first reporting year of the new target period by more than
three years. For example, for 2030 as the target year and a target period between 2025 and 2030,
the base year shall be selected from the period between 2022 and 2025. For the following five-
year period, the base year should be 2030. If early reductions have been achieved, these should
be explained in another table or by adding new columns. Further explanations are available at ID
531 GHG emission reduction targets – base year.
ESRS 1 Chapter 7.1 Presenting comparative information states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose
comparative information in respect of the previous period for all quantitative metrics and
monetary amounts disclosed in the current period.’ That is, the undertaking shall present previous
reporting year data for comparison purposes in the third ‘comparative’ column.
In column N (fourth column), the undertaking presents the current reporting year figures, and in
the fifth column it shall present the percentage reduction / increase of the value in the current
year over the previous year.
The milestones and target years columns are for reporting target information for the years 2025,
2030 and 2050 (if available). It is suggested to include all target values between 2035 and 2050
that the undertaking has set by using the column ‘2050’ as a placeholder for those targets or by
adding more columns to the table as applicable – given the requirement in ESRS E1 paragraph 34
(d) to update the target year every five years from 2030 onwards. Finally, the ninth column is for
reporting the average annual emission reduction figure by using the following formula:

Answer
Yes, the undertaking is required to disclose its total GHG emissions disaggregated by Scopes 1 and
2 and significant Scope 3 in accordance with the table provided in ESRS E1 paragraph AR 48. Note
that the undertaking is only required to fill the cells of the table that are applicable to the
undertaking, meaning that for Scope 3 only significant categories (see ESRS E1 paragraph AR 46)
are to be disclosed and that the cells under ‘Milestones and target years’ are to be filled according
to the targets set by the undertaking.
The columns of the table are the following:
The base year: for reporting the value of the metric in the base year against which progress
towards the target is measured
Comparative year: for reporting the previous year’s (compared to the reporting year’s)
value for the metric
N: the value for the metric in the current year

Question asked
Is there a clear definition or exhaustive list of ‘regulated Emission Trading Schemes’?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 48 (b) and AR 44
Key terms
Emission trading schemes
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 48 states: ‘The disclosure on gross Scope 1 GHG emissions required by
paragraph 44 (a) shall include:
(a) the gross Scope 1 GHG emissions in metric tonnes of CO2eq; and
(b) the percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated emission trading schemes.’
The related ESRS E1 paragraph AR 44 states: ‘When preparing the information on the percentage
of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated emission trading schemes required under paragraph 48
(b), the undertaking shall:
(a) consider GHG emissions from the installations it operates that are subject to regulated
Emission Trading Schemes (ETS), including the EU-ETS, national ETS and non-EU ETS, if
applicable;
(b) only include emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3;
(c) ensure the same accounting period for gross Scope 1 GHG emissions and GHG emissions
regulated under the ETS; and

Answer
The undertaking shall consider GHG emissions from the installations it operates that are subject
to regulated Emission Trading Schemes (ETS), including the EU-ETS, national ETS and non-EU ETS,
if applicable (ESRS E1 AR 44). The schemes that fall under this requirement, therefore, include not
only EU ETS but those regulated ETS which are either upcoming and/or non-EU trading schemes.
Only emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3 shall be included. Separate ETS for
other greenhouse gases do not have to be included. Currently, there is no clear definition or
exhaustive list of ‘regulated Emission Trading Schemes’. CDP provides an indicative, non-
exhaustive list of ETS around the world, showing examples of ETS. The list is the following:

Question ID 698 – Database for GHG emission factors
Release date
July 2024
Question asked
Is it allowed to use OEKOBAUDAT data after EN 15804 to report GHG emissions within the ESRS?
Within ESRS, the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 is allowed to use and indicate
the use of Environmental Footprint EF v3.1 impact categories. On the JRC website, it seems as if
EF v.3.1 impact categories and EN 15804 impact categories are harmonised. Does this mean that
these two impact categories (EF V3.1 and OEKOBAUDAT) can be used? Can they be summed up
when reporting after (EU) 2021/2279?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 39
Key terms
GHG emissions; impact categories; GHG emission factor database
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 39 states: ‘When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions
as required by paragraph 44, the undertaking shall:
(a) consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard (version 2004) [and] may consider Commission Recommendation
(EU) 2021/2279 or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064-1:2018. If the
undertaking already applies the GHG accounting methodology of ISO 14064-1: 2018, it
shall nevertheless comply with the requirements of this standard (e.g. regarding
reporting boundaries and the disclosure of market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions); … and
(c) use the most recent Global Warming Potential (GWP) values published by the IPCC based
on a 100-year time horizon to calculate Co2eq emissions of non-Co2 gases.’

The ÖKOBAUDAT platform is offered as a standardised database for ecological evaluations of
buildings by the German Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Development and Building.
The EN 15804 is the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) standard for the sustainability of
construction works and services. This standard harmonises the structure of EPDs in the
construction sector, making the information transparent and comparable. Under EN 15804 the
impact category ‘climate change total’ relates to total GHG emissions calculated on the basis of a
Global Warming Potential of 100 years (GWP100), which is consistent with ESRS E1 paragraph
AR 39 (d).
Nevertheless, EN 15084 is a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standard, which may give rise to some
inconsistencies with the application of a yearly annual inventory approach, such as the one
adopted in corporate sustainability reporting.
Answer
When reporting on its GHG emissions, the requirements set out in ESRS E1 need to be met.
According to ESRS E1, an undertaking shall consider the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard
(version 2004) and, in addition, it may also consider Commission Recommendation (EU)
2021/2279 or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064-1:2018. Neither the GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard, the EN ISO 14064-1 nor EN 15804 have specific norms on the adequacy of
emission factors for specific uses within an inventory calculation. These issues are largely assessed
through professional judgment, which may include asking for external professional advice that
could help determine the applicability of any given emission factor to a specific calculation case.
Question ID 718 – Disaggregation of GHG emissions
Release date
July 2024
Question asked
It seems like in the disclosure requirements there is no distinction in GHG emissions based on
fossil resources and non-fossil resources. Why is this, and would EFRAG recommend emphasising
this difference in CSRD-reporting anyway?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 37, AR 39, AR 41, AR 43; ESRS 1 paragraph 55
Key terms
GHG emissions, disaggregation
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 41 states: ‘In line with ESRS 1 chapter 3.7, the undertaking shall
disaggregate information on its GHG emissions as appropriate. For example, the undertaking may
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 140 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
disaggregate its Scope 1, 2, 3, or total GHG emissions by country, operating segments, economic
activity, subsidiary, GHG category (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and other GHG
considered by the undertaking) or source type (stationary combustion, mobile combustion,
process emissions and fugitive emissions).’
ESRS 1 chapter 3.7 refers to the level of disaggregation applied to support a proper understanding
of the material impacts, risks and opportunities of an undertaking. Specifically, ESRS 1 chapter 3.7
paragraph 55 states: ‘When defining the appropriate level of disaggregation for reporting, the
undertaking shall consider the disaggregation adopted in its materiality assessment.’
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 39 states: ‘When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions
as required by paragraph 44, the undertaking shall:
(a) consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol Corporate
Standard (version 2004) …’
ESRS E1 paragraph 37 requires a breakdown of energy consumption between fossil, nuclear and
renewable sources. Given that CO2 emissions are often associated with energy consumption, E1-
5 can provide an indication on the fossil origin of emissions.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 43 requires a disclosure on biogenic emissions of CO emissions from the
2
combustion or biodegradation of biomass separately from Scope 1 GHG emissions, ESRS E1
paragraph AR 45 requires it separately from Scope 2 GHG emissions and ESRS E1 paragraph AR 46
separately from Scope 3 GHG emissions.
Answer
ESRS E1 paragraphs AR 43, 45 and 46 require disclosure of biogenic emissions of CO emissions
2
from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass separately from the Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG
emissions.
In addition, the undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information when needed to support
a proper understanding of its material impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 1 chapter 3.7 Level
of disaggregation). It shall disaggregate information on its GHG emissions as appropriate (ESRS
E1 paragraph AR 41). Therefore, the undertaking shall disaggregate its GHG emissions by the
distinction between fossil and non-fossil resources if considered necessary for the understanding
of the impacts, risks and opportunities linked to these emissions. As stated by ESRS 1 chapter 3.7
paragraph 55, the level of disaggregation used is the one adopted in the undertaking’s materiality
assessment.
Also, ESRS E1-5 paragraph 37 requires a breakdown of energy consumption between fossil,
nuclear and renewable sources. Given that CO emissions are often associated with energy
2
consumption, ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement E1-5 will often provide a reliable indication on the
fossil origin of an undertaking’s emissions.
Overall, when calculating and reporting on GHG emissions, ESRS E1 paragraph AR 39 (a) states
that the undertaking shall consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004). ESRS do not specify these further but refer to
the GHG Protocol.

Question ID 831 – Contractual instruments
Release date
November 2024
Question asked
Should the percentage of contractual instruments be calculated in terms of electricity
consumption, not in terms of Scope 2 GHG emissions?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 45 (d)
Key terms
Contractual instruments; scope 2
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 45 states: ‘When preparing the information on gross Scope 2 GHG emissions
required under paragraph 49, the undertaking shall: …
(d) apply the location-based and market-based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions
and provide information on the share and types of contractual instruments. Location-based
method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on average energy generation emission
factors for defined locations, including local, subnational, or national boundaries (GHG
Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015). Market-based method quantifies Scope 2
GHG emissions based on GHG emissions emitted by the generators from which the
reporting entity contractually purchases electricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled
instruments on their own (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015); in this case,
the undertaking may disclose the share of market-based scope 2 GHG emissions linked to
purchased electricity bundled with instruments such as Guarantee of Origins or Renewable
Energy Certificates. The undertaking shall provide information about the share and types of
contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes
about the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 142 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
The percentage of contractual instruments is calculated in terms of the Scope 2 activity data –
this is the consumption of purchased or acquired electricity. The general expression is:
Electricity consumption backed by contractual instruments
% 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 =
Total electricity consumption
Electricity is used in this context as a shorthand for purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam
and cooling (as per GHG Protocol). There are different types of contractual instruments such
Guarantees of Origin, Renewable Energy Certificates, direct contracts, etc.
Question ID 882 – Data availability for biogenic emissions in Scope 3
Release date
November 2024
Question asked
Can a preparer state that data for biogenic emissions in Scope 3 is ‘not available’ as it is specifically
possible for Scope 2 biogenic emissions?
ESRS Reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs AR 45 (e) and AR 46 (j); ESRS 2 Chapter 5.2 Estimation using sector averages
and proxies
Key terms
Biogenic emissions; Scope 2; Scope 3; data availability; proxies; value chain
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 45 (e) states the undertaking shall ‘disclose biogenic emissions of CO2
carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass separately from the Scope 2 GHG
emissions but include emissions of other types of GHG (in particular, CH4 and N2O). In case the
emission factors applied do not separate the percentage of biomass or biogenic CO2, the
undertaking shall disclose this. In case GHG emissions other than CO2 (particularly CH4 and N2O)
are not available for, or excluded from, location-based grid average emissions factors or with the
market-based method information, the undertaking shall disclose this.’
In addition to Scope 2 emissions, ESRS E1 AR 46 (j) requires the undertaking to report biogenic
Scope 3 emissions separately. ESRS E1 paragraph AR 46 (j) states that the undertaking shall
‘disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass that occur
in its upstream and downstream value chain separately from the gross Scope 3 GHG emissions,
and include emissions of other types of GHG (such as CH4 and N2O), and emissions of CO2 that
occur in the life cycle of biomass other than from combustion or biodegradation (such as GHG
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 143 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
emissions from processing or transporting biomass) in the calculation of Scope 3 GHG
emissions …’.
ESRS 1 paragraphs 69 and 71 state that:
‘69. There are circumstances where the undertaking cannot collect the information about its
upstream and downstream value chain as required by paragraph 63 after making
reasonable efforts to do so. In these circumstances, the undertaking shall estimate the
information to be reported about its upstream and downstream value chain by using all
reasonable and supportable information, such as sector-average data and other proxies’;
and
‘71. With reference to metrics, in many cases, in particular for environmental matters for which
proxies are available, the undertaking may be able to comply with the reporting
requirements without collecting data from the actors in its upstream and downstream value
chain, especially from SMEs, for example, when calculating the undertaking’s GHG Scope 3
emissions.’
Illustrative example related to emission factors for biogenic emissions with
fuel combustion in mobile sources:
Access to easily available emission factors for biogenic emissions associated with fuel combustion
in mobile sources may not be readily available. However, producers of vehicles using internal
combustion engines may have to model Scope 3 CO2 biogenic emissions – if deemed material -
based on this data. If the estimation model is based on car sales per geography and average
mileage of car during its useful life this could encompass finding country by country specific data
on biofuel blends per type of fuel (diesel, gasoline, kerosene, etc), as well as likely evolution in
future years. This will then allow to introduce a correction for the CO2 emissions and CO2 biogenic
emissions of their Scope 3, Use of sold products category.
This example illustrates that while there may not be any “off the shelf” biogenic CO2 emissions
for mobile combustion, it is possible to develop models and data that allows for their
measurement. However, developing an emission model and its associated data will depend on
the scope 3 category emissions being modelled and the specific facts and circumstances of the
company.
Answer
As a reminder, it has to be clarified that AR 45(e) does not allow for the omission of Scope 2 CO
2
biogenic emissions. What it says is that, in case that CH and N O emissions are not available
4 2
within the location-based or market-based emission factors, this fact shall be disclosed. However,
this does not prevent the undertaking from estimating these emissions in case they are significant,
for example based on the emission factors provided by the IPCC (see Tables 2.2 to 2.10) for specific
fuels and combustion technologies.
Regarding GHG Scope 3 emissions, the principle of what to disclose is similar to GHG Scope 2
emissions. However, depending on the significant GHG Scope 3 category and the specific facts and
circumstances of the undertaking, the identification of biogenic CO2 emission sources, of biogenic
CO2 emission factors or the specific approach to model the biogenic CO2 emissions of the Scope
3 category may be challenging. EFRAG will develop illustrative examples in further guidance of
approaches that can be taken to model Scope 3 biogenic CO2 emissions. [An illustrative example
is listed in the background to this question.]

Question asked
ESRS E1 paragraph 60 mentions the words ‘after approximately 90-95% of GHG reduction’.
(1) Does this mean that under ESRS my claim to net-zero will not be recognised if I neutralise
20% of my total reduction target to reach net-zero through removal techniques?
(2) Is capturing and storing CO emitted through my own operations considered to be

‘reduction’ or ‘removal’?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 60 and 56 (a); Annex II Acronyms and Defined Terms: Net-zero target, GHG
removal and storage
Key terms
Net-zero targets, GHG removals
Background
Regarding the net-zero target, ESRS E1 paragraph 60 states: ‘In the case where the undertaking
discloses a net-zero target in addition to the gross GHG emission reduction targets in accordance
with Disclosure Requirement E1-4 paragraph 30, [the undertaking] shall explain the scope,
methodologies and frameworks applied and how the residual GHG emissions (after
approximately 90-95% of GHG emission reduction, with the possibility for justified sectoral
variations in line with a recognised sectoral decarbonisation pathway) are intended to be
neutralised by, for example, GHG removals in its own operations and upstream and downstream
value chain.’
Annex II Acronyms and Defined Terms defines net-zero target: ‘Setting a net-zero target at the
level of an undertaking aligned with meeting societal climate goals means (1) achieving a scale of
value chain emissions reductions consistent with the depth of abatement at the point of reaching
global net-zero in 1.5˚C pathways, and (2) neutralising the impact of any residual emissions (after
approximately 90-95% of GHG emission reduction) by permanently removing an equivalent
volume of CO .’

Regarding GHG removals, ESRS E1 paragraph 56 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose:
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 145 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(a) GHG removals and storage in metric tonnes of CO resulting from projects it may have
2eq
developed in its own operations or contributed to in its upstream and downstream value
chain …’.
Annex II Acronyms and Defined Terms defines GHG removal and storage: ‘[Anthropogenic]
Removals refer to the withdrawal of GHGs from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human
activities. These include enhancing biological sinks of CO and using chemical engineering to
2
achieve long-term removal and storage.’
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from industrial and energy-related sources, which alone does
not remove CO from the atmosphere, can reduce atmospheric CO if it is combined with
2 2
bioenergy production (BECCS). Removals can be subject to reversals, which are any movement of
stored GHG out of the intended storage that re-enters the surface and atmosphere. For example,
if a forest that was grown to remove a specific amount of CO is subject to a wildfire, the emissions
2
captured in the trees are reversed.
The European Commission refers to this process as follows: ‘Capturing carbon dioxide directly
from the atmosphere (DACCS) or from the combustion or fermentation of biogenic carbon
(BECCS) has the potential to achieve negative emissions (carbon removals). The captured carbon
is subsequently either stored underground or utilized in the production of synthetic materials
such as fuels, chemicals, and building materials’ (see here for more information). For storage, CO
2
is captured from its source and compressed and transported to geological formations, including
oil and gas reservoirs, unmendable coal seams and deep saline reservoirs where it will be stored.
Answer
(1) Does this mean that under ESRS my claim to net-zero will not be recognised if I
neutralise 20% of my total reduction target to reach net-zero through removal

Net-zero target means neutralising the impact of any residual emissions (after approximately 90-
95% of GHG emission reduction) by permanently removing an equivalent volume of CO (see the
2
definition of net-zero target above in the background). As such, neutralising more than 10% (e.g.
20%, as stated in the question) of carbon removals would not qualify to a claim of achieving a net-
zero target in accordance with the ESRS definition. As stated in ESRS E1 paragraph 60, the 90-95%
of GHG emission reduction is subject to sectoral variations, which may be reflected in the
undertaking’s net-zero target.
(2) Is capturing and storing CO emitted through my own operations considered to be
2
‘reduction’ or ‘removal’?
Please refer to the above definition of GHG removal and storage in the background section to
determine whether capturing and storing CO emitted through the undertaking’s operations
2
would qualify as removal. It will be considered a removal if it results in the withdrawal of GHG
from the atmosphere because of deliberate human activity (such as, for example, BECCS or
carbon stored in soil through enhanced agriculture practices). It should be noted that all carbon
capture and storage technologies have adverse effects that should be considered.
If an undertaking is capturing and storing CO2 that it has emitted through its own operations, this
does not necessarily represent a removal. If the carbon is of fossil origin, it may represent a
transfer of CO2 into geological storage (see article 49 of Commission Implementing Regulation

Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions reporting, an emission reduction. In all cases –
whether removals or transfers of fossil CO – there needs to be a policy to monitor reversals from
2
the storage pools (geological or otherwise). In case of reversals of removals (ESRS E1 paragraph
AR 58 (g)) or transfers of fossil CO , it shall be accounted as a CO emission under ESRS E1

Disclosure Requirement E1-6. Removal reversals may also be reported in a separate line item, as
per ESRS E1 paragraph AR 60.

calculation, monitoring, and verification of the project’s GHG emissions and removals.’
Annex II List of Acronyms and Defined Terms defines ‘carbon credits’: ‘A carbon credit is a
convertible and transferable instrument representing GHG emissions that have been reduced,
avoided or removed through projects that are verified according to recognised quality standards.
Carbon credits can be issued from projects within (sometimes referred to as insets) or outside an
undertaking’s value chain (sometimes referred to as offsets).’
Answer
As stated in ESRS E1 paragraph 63, the undertaking shall consider recognised quality standards
when preparing information on carbon credits. There is currently no list of recognised quality
standards for carbon credit recognised by the EU or recommended by EFRAG. The definition of
recognised quality standard for carbon credit, detailed in the Annex II List of Acronyms and
Defined Terms, enumerates a list of criteria that need to be met:
(a) must be verifiable by independent third parties; and
(b) make requirements and project reports publicly available and at a minimum ensure:
(i) additionality,
(ii) permanence,
(iii) avoidance of double counting and provide rules for calculation,
(iv) monitoring, and
(v) verification of the project’s GHG emissions and removals.
If those criteria are met, an undertaking can consider the carbon credit as a recognised quality
standard for carbon credit.

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Reference
ESRS E1 paragraph 56
Key terms
GHG removals; project definition
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 56 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose:
(a) GHG removals and storage in metric tonnes of CO2eq resulting from projects it may have
developed in its own operations, or contributed to in its upstream and downstream value
chain …’
In accordance with the GHG Protocol for Project Accounting, a project is ‘A specific activity or set
of activities intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase the storage of carbon, or enhance GHG
removals from the atmosphere. A GHG project may be a stand-alone project, or a component of
a larger non-GHG project.’
Answer
In the context of ESRS E1 paragraph 56 (a), projects are all activities/interventions conducted by
the undertaking which may lead to GHG removals and storage. This is consistent with the project
definition provided in the GHG Protocol for Project Accounting (which does not only refer to GHG
removals; see ‘Background’). It is not limited to asset-driven investments although projects in
own operations may imply new asset investments or new investments in existing assets. Projects
also encompass, for instance, new application for products. Examples of GHG removal projects
include reforestation/afforestation, soil carbon enhancement, ecological restoration, blue carbon
removals, integration of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technologies and
Direct Air Capture of CO2 with storage (DACCS). Projects will usually test new concepts,
technologies or products within the operating context of the company and have both a novelty
component as well as a transitory nature – the related activity is operated as a project for a certain
limited period.
Question ID 636 – Definition of types of removals
Release date
July 2024
Question asked
What are, or where can I find, the definitions of ‘biogenic removal and storage’, ‘removal and
storage from land use’, ‘technological removal and storage’ and ‘hybrid removal and storage’?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 58
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 149 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
Removals, biogenic; removal and storage of land use; technological removal and storage; removal,
hybrid and storage
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 58 states: ‘When preparing the information on GHG removals and storage
from the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain required
under paragraphs 56 (a) and 58, the undertaking shall:
(a) consider, as far as applicable, the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004),
Product Standard (version 2011), Agriculture Guidance (version 2014), land use, land-use
change, and forestry guidance for GHG project accounting (version 2006); …’
The GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard defines ‘biogenic’ as
‘Produced by living organisms or biological processes, but not fossilized or from fossil sources’.
The ESRS Glossary defines ‘Land use (change)’ as ‘The human use of a specific area for a certain
purpose (such as residential, agriculture, recreation, industrial, etc.) influenced by, but not
synonymous with, land cover. Land-use change refers to a change in the use or management of
land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover.’
The ESRS Glossary defines ‘GHG removal and storage’: ‘[Anthropogenic] Removals refer to the
withdrawal of GHGs from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. These include
enhancing biological sinks of CO and using chemical engineering to achieve long-term removal
2
and storage. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from industrial and energy-related sources, which
alone does not remove CO in the atmosphere, can reduce atmospheric CO2 if it is combined with
2
bioenergy production (BECCS). Removals can be subject to reversals, which are any movement of
stored GHG out of the intended storage that re-enters the surface and atmosphere. For example,
if a forest that was grown to remove a specific amount of CO is subject to a wildfire, the emissions
2
captured in the trees are reversed’.
The provisional agreement for a carbon removals and carbon farming (CRCF) Regulation by the
European Parliament and the Council of the EU reached on 20 February 2024 defines ‘biogenic
carbon pool’ as ‘living biomass, litter, dead wood, dead organic matter, mineral soils and organic
soils as set out in points (a) to (f) of Part B of Annex I to Regulation 2018/841 ...’.
Answer
Based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004), the Product LCA and Reporting
Standard (version 2011), Agriculture Guidance (version 2014) and Land use, land-use change, and
forestry Guidance for GHG project accounting (version 2006), the following definitions can be
derived.
(a) Biogenic removal and storage refers to GHG removal and storage as defined in ESRS,
which is classified as biogenic. This is produced by living organisms or biological processes
but not by fossilized or from fossil sources. One example is forest restoration. For a
detailed explanation of ‘biogenic’, the undertaking can refer to the GHG Protocol (e.g.
GHG Product LCA and Reporting standard: ‘Biogenic removals are due to the uptake of
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 150 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
CO by biogenic materials during photosynthesis, while non-biogenic removals only occur
2
if CO is removed from the atmosphere by a non-biogenic product during its production
2
or use stage …’.
(b) Removal and storage from land use refers to GHG removal and storage as defined in ESRS
resulting from land-use, which is defined, too, in ESRS (see background). Additionally,
ESRS E1 AR 57 (b) provides examples of such activities (afforestation, reforestation, forest
restoration, urban tree planting, agroforestry, building soil carbon). Also, the undertaking
can refer to the GHG Product LCA and Reporting standard (2011) and the GHG Protocol
for Project Accounting standard (2005) that speaks to GHG removals due to land-use
change.
(c) Technological removal and storage refers to GHG removal and storage as defined in
ESRS, which results from use of technology. Such activities may resemble examples
provided in ESRS E1 AR 57 (b) (direct air capture). The undertaking may refer to Annex A
in the (draft) GHG Protocol Land Sector and Removals Guidance for additional
information.
(d) Hybrid removal and storage refers to GHG removal and storage as defined in ESRS, which
results from combining the use of technology with biogenic removals. ESRS E1 AR 57 (b)
provides an example of this activity (bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage).
Undertakings interested in carbon removals and carbon farming are also advised to check the
provisional agreement reached on 20 February 2024 by the European Parliament and the Council
of the EU for a Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) Regulation.

etc.), technological (e.g. direct air capture), or hybrid (e.g. bioenergy with CO2 capture
and storage), and technological details about the removal, the type of storage and, if
applicable, the transport of removed GHGs; …’
Answer
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 57 requires a description of ‘technological details about the removal, the
type of storage and, if applicable, the transport of removed GHGs.’ For some removal
technologies (BECS, DACS), transport of the captured GHGs to the storage is necessary. The
technical details of both storage and transportation are included in the technological details
relevant to the GHG removals in this example and shall therefore be reported if applicable. For
an explanation of GHG removals and storage, please see explanation ID 432 Net zero target and

Question asked
Is the disclosure of monetary amount and proportion of assets at risk over the short-/medium-
/long-term meant to be broken down by the time horizon (short-/medium-/long-term) or by a
single aggregate number for assets at risk in any of those time horizons?
ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 66 and 67, AR 70 and AR 73
Key terms
Assets at risk
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 152 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
ESRS E1 paragraph 66 states: ‘The disclosure of anticipated financial effects from material physical
risks required by paragraph 64 (a) shall include:
(a) the monetary amount and proportion (percentage) of assets at material physical risk over
the short-, medium- and long-term before considering climate change adaptation actions,
with the monetary amounts of these assets disaggregated by acute and chronic physical
risk …’
ESRS E1 paragraph 67 states: ‘The disclosure of anticipated financial effects from material
transition risks required by paragraph 64 (b) shall include: …
(b) the monetary amount and proportion (percentage) of assets at material transition risk over
the short-, medium- and long-term before considering climate mitigation actions.’
As stated in both articles, the undertaking shall disclose the monetary amount and proportion of
assets at risk considering the different time horizons (short-, medium- and long-term). Guidance
on how to calculate these figures can be found in ESRS E1 paragraph AR 70 to AR 76, which clarify
that the proportion can be done as a single amount or range.
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 70 (a) states: ‘The estimate of monetary amounts and proportion of assets
at physical risk may be presented as either a single amount or range.’
ESRS E1 paragraph AR 73 (a) states: ‘… an estimate of the amount of potentially stranded assets
(in monetary amounts and as a proportion/percentage) from the reporting year until 2030 and
from 2030 to 2050 … may be expressed as a range of asset values based on different climate and
policy scenarios …’.
Answer
ESRS E1 paragraphs 66 and 67 do not require a breakdown of monetary amount figures by the
three time horizons. It rather requires the disclosure of a monetary amount that is the result of
cumulative financial effects assessed for each of the time horizons (short-, medium- and long-
term).
For example, the undertaking shall evaluate the assets at material physical risk considering short-
, medium- and long-term physical climate risks. As the time span increases, the likelihood of
certain climate events impacting the assets is also expected to increase – either because the
events become more frequent or because the period for which they can materialise has become
larger. For this reason, when doing the analysis from the short- to long-term perspective, more
assets are likely to be impacted. These are then accounted for with the carrying value in the
financial statement at the reporting date (ESRS E1 paragraph AR 70), and their carrying value is
added up to a single amount and reported for each of the time horizons (short-, medium- and
long-term). To provide more contextual information, the undertaking may disclose the expected
carrying value of the assets at the time when the climate effect will materialise, taking into
account the amortisation schedule. When identifying the amount and share of current assets that
may be at risk, the time horizons (short-, medium- and long-term) should be considered. If
applying different scenarios or if there is higher uncertainty on assets at risk in the medium- or
long-term, the disclosure can be provided as a range (ESRS E1 paragraphs AR 70 (a) and 73 (a)). A
breakdown by time horizon is not required but may be reported.
When reporting this information, preparers can consider the proportionality principle.
Information on climate-related risks over the long-term is useful for giving direction. However,
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 153 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
while the likelihood of certain climate events can be expected to increase over time, long-term
climate information remains uncertain in varying degrees. It is, therefore, difficult for an
undertaking to anticipate and adapt financially beyond five to ten years both credibly and
verifiably. Consequently, the quality and purpose differ between short-term and long-term
information.

Please provide more clarity around the requirement to report the anticipated financial effects
from chronic and acute physical risks in relation to climate change. The CSRD and ESRS language
is not very clear on whether the requirement is to report the financial effects of the expected

Financial materiality; climate risk; financial effects
Background
The question that was originally submitted, which was edited for clarity, is the following: ‘I would
like to ask to provide more clarity around the requirement to report monetary impact from chronic
and acute climate risks. The CSRD and ESRS language is not very clear if the requirement is to
report the monetary impact of the expected damage&loss from chronic and acute aspects, or if it
is simply amount reporting the monetary amount of the values of the assets themselves that see
chronic or acute exposure.’
ESRS E1 paragraph 66 states: ‘The disclosure of anticipated financial effects from material physical
risks required by paragraph 64 (a) shall include … the monetary amount and proportion
(percentage) of assets at material physical risk over the short-, medium- and long-term before
considering climate change adaptation actions, with the monetary amounts of these assets
disaggregated by acute and chronic physical risk.’
The related ESRS E1 paragraph AR 70 states: ‘When preparing the information on assets at
material physical risk that is required to be disclosed under paragraph 66 (a), the undertaking
shall:
(a) calculate the assets at material physical risk in terms of monetary amount and as a
proportion (percentage) of total assets at the reporting date (i.e. the proportion is an
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 154 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
estimate of the carrying value of assets at material physical risk divided by total
carrying value as stated in the statement of financial position or balance sheet). The
estimate of assets at material physical risk shall be derived starting from the assets
recognised in the financial statements ... To contextualise this information, the
undertaking shall:
i. disclose the location of its significant assets at material physical risk. Significant
assets located in the EU territory shall be aggregated by NUTS codes 3 level
digits (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). For significant assets
located outside the EU territory, the breakdown by NUTS code will only be
provided where applicable …
(c) to contextualise this information, the undertaking shall: …
ii. disaggregate the monetary amounts of assets at risk by acute and chronic
physical risk.’
The ESRS E1 AR 70 (c) (i) (ii) is consistent with the requirements included in Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 Template 5: Banking book – Climate change physical
risk: Exposures subject to physical risk, which states that ‘Institutions shall disclose the gross
carrying amount of exposures sensitive to impact from chronic climate-change events only,
including hazards relating to gradual changes in weather and climate and having a possible impact
on economic output and productivity [as well as] the gross carrying amount of exposures sensitive
to impact from acute climate change events only, including hazards that may cause sudden
damage to properties, disruption of supply chains, and depreciation of assets [and] the gross
carrying amount subject to impact from both chronic and acute climate change events …’.
Answer
The undertaking is required to report the monetary amount of the assets that are exposed to
impact from chronic and/or acute climate change events. This provides a measure of exposure to
climate risks. The intention is not to report the monetary amount of the expected damage and
loss from the chronic and acute aspects, which would be more complex and uncertain to estimate.
The requirement to disaggregate the monetary amounts of assets by acute and chronic physical
risk (see ESRS E1 paragraph 66 (a)) stems from the requirements detailed by the Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 Template 5: Banking book – Climate change physical
risk: Exposures subject to physical risk (note that this regulation uses the term ‘financial impact’).
This regulation states that the undertaking is required to disclose:
(a) the gross carrying amount of exposures sensitive to impact from chronic climate-change
events;
(b) the gross carrying amount of exposures sensitive to impact from acute climate change
events; and
(c) the gross carrying amount subject to impact from both chronic and acute climate change
events.

ESRS reference
ESRS E1 paragraphs 20, 21, AR 9-15
Key terms
Climate-risk analysis
Background
The original question received was the following: ’What is the difference between: …?’
The ESRS distinguish between impacts, risks and opportunities (‘IROs’) of the undertaking, which
are defined in Annex II of the Delegated Act. The undertaking is required to disclose the processes
to identify the IROs and to assess which ones are material (ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-
1). Consequently, the ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 seeks transparency
on the approach taken to assess its material climate-related IROs.
ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 is conceptually divided into paragraphs
that require describing the processes to assess:
(a) impacts on climate change (ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 (a), AR 9 and AR 10);
(b) climate-related physical risks (ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 (b) and AR 11); and
(c) climate-related transition risks and opportunities (ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 (c) and AR 12).
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 156 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
The ESRS E1 paragraphs 20 (b)(i) and 20 (c)(i) as well as the corresponding AR 11 and AR 12 refer
directly to specific climate scenarios. At the same time, ESRS E1 paragraph 21 requires
information on how climate-scenario analysis was used to inform the identification and
assessment of physical risks and transition risks and opportunities. Additionally, ESRS E1
paragraph AR 13 seeks transparency on how the scenario analysis was used in relation to
disclosures in ESRS E1 paragraphs 19 (ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement SBM-3) as well as ESRS E1
paragraphs 20, 21, AR 10 and AR 11 (ESRS 2 IRO-1). ESRS E1 paragraph AR 15 requires explanation
of how the climate scenarios are compatible with critical assumptions made in the financial
statements. Finally, ESRS E1 paragraph AR 14 provides a reference to existing guidance,
frameworks and standards on scenario analysis.
Annex II to the Delegated Act introduces definitions of impacts, sustainability-related impacts,
risks, sustainability-related risks, material risks, physical risks, climate-related physical risks,
climate-related transition risks, opportunities, material opportunities and climate-related
opportunities.
Answer
Impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters are assessed for materiality and
reported when material. The identification of material impacts, risks and opportunities is the
outcome of the materiality assessment process.
Paragraphs 20 and 21 of ESRS E1 set the Disclosure Requirements related to the process followed
in order to identify material impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change that are
to be reported.
Preparing a scenario analysis is not a direct requirement in ESRS E1 per se, but several ESRS E1
disclosures refer to it as a foundation for the information to be disclosed. For instance, when the
undertaking develops climate scenario analysis, its outcome informs the materiality assessment,
particularly for the identification of risks and opportunities (ESRS E1 paragraph 21). It is generally
used to develop the resilience analysis (ESRS E1 paragraph 19).
Scenario analysis involves identifying and evaluating a range of future events and outcomes under
conditions of uncertainty. It deals with the underlying uncertainty in the quantification of the
future value of decision variables for one single scenario as well as with the uncertainty of
different future scenarios. Scenario analysis helps ensure the quality of the information provided.
In ESRS this is reflected in the Disclosure Requirement on processes to identify and assess climate
risks, which requires explanation of whether the assessment of climate-related physical risks
considered at least a high emission climate scenario and whether the assessment of transition
risks considered at least a climate scenario in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no
or limited overshooting. These requirements provide transparency on how the assessment of
physical and transition risks of climate change has been done and help to better understand how
they may impact the undertaking’s business, strategies and financial performance over time.

disclose this to be the case. It may disclose a timeframe in which it aims to have such a process in
place’.
Answer
(1) What does ‘consultation with affected communities’ – in the case of pollution, for
instance – mean in terms of actions?
ESRS E2 does not specify the type of actions that an undertaking is to take to consult with affected
communities. In general, the ESRS do not mandate behaviour. However, ESRS 2 requires
transparency on the undertaking’s consultation with affected stakeholders or experts (ESRS 2
paragraph 53 (b)(iii)). This disclosure of ESRS 2 is complemented with ESRS E2 IRO paragraph
11 (b) for the pollution topical standard; therefore, the undertaking is to comply with the IRO-1
specifications in ESRS 2 and ESRS E2 regardless of whether pollution has been assessed as material
by the undertaking. In terms of examples as to how this engagement could be disclosed, ESRS S3-
2 on processes for engaging with affected communities about impacts and ESRS E4 paragraph
17 (e), provides reference points for this datapoint.
(2) Could a company be compliant if it states that it has not done it even though its
pollution levels are under control under current law?
Yes, the undertaking is compliant with ESRS E2 paragraph 11 (b) if it disclosed that it did not
conduct a consultation with affected communities. It is to be noted that the focus of this specific
disclosure requirement is not on legal compliance with regard to pollution levels and it cannot be
considered an exemption to satisfy this requirement. Here, ESRS E2 only requires stating whether
the undertaking conducted consultations with affected communities as input for the pollution-
related materiality assessment. If such consultation process was not adopted, the undertaking is
to state that fact and, optionally, it can also provide a timeframe in which it expects to have a
consultation process in place. Only in the case in which the undertaking did have this consultation

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
process in place will it also need to explain how it consulted the affected communities on
pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities.

ESRS E2-1 Policies related to pollution
Question ID 186 – Substances of very high concern
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
One of the requirements in the ESRS E2 Pollution Standard is to describe the phase-out of
substances of very high concern (SVHCs). How can undertakings identify SVHCs that are to be
phased out?
ESRS reference
ESRS E2 paragraph 6; Disclosure Requirement E2-1 paragraph 15 (b)
Key terms
Substances of very high concern; SVHCs
Background
Disclosure Requirement E2-1 mandates that the undertaking disclose how its policies address the
substitution and minimisation of substances of concern (SoC) as well as the phase-out of
substances of very high concern (SVHCs) within its own operations and throughout its supply
chain.
The main goal of the EU policies regarding SVHCs is to ensure a high level of protection for human
health and the environment by phasing them out where possible.
As explained in Annex II to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772, Substances of Very
High Concern (SVHCs) are those that meet the criteria laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006 (REACH) and that were identified in accordance with Article 59 (1) of that
Regulation.
The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) website includes a public registry for intentions, which
lists the intentions and Annex XV restriction proposals received by the ECHA. Once an Annex XV
SVHC dossier has been prepared and the scientific evidence for identifying a substance as a SVHC
has been outlined, a consultation of the Member States and interested parties is required, as
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 160 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
specified in Article 59 of REACH. Further details on this consultation process are available on the
ECHA website at http://echa.europa.eu/proposals-to-identify-substances-of-very-high-concern.
At the end of the process laid down in Article 59 of REACH, the substance may be included in the
Candidate List – which is the list relevant for the identification of SVHCs (please see ID 301).
As the inclusion of substances in the Candidate List results in a number of immediate legal
obligations on listing substances on their own, in mixtures and in articles, it is an indication that
these substances are of concern to authorities and that they might be prioritised for further
regulation.
Answer
The requirement in ESRS E2 paragraph 15 (b) is to indicate whether and how the undertaking’s
policy aligns with the public policy objectives of phasing out SVHCs as outlined in REACH and in
line with the ambitions of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability.
To identify SVHCs, undertakings consult the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern
managed by the European Chemicals Agency pursuant to Article 59 (10) of Regulation (EC) No
1907/2006 (REACH). The Candidate List is provided by the ECHA on its official website and can be
directly consulted by undertakings for information purposes.

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 161 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 requires undertakings to explain how they determined the
materiality of pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities.
ESRS 1 paragraph 33 states: ‘When disclosing information on policies, actions and targets in
relation to a sustainability matter that has been assessed to be material, the undertaking shall
include the information prescribed by all the Disclosure Requirements and datapoints in the
topical and sector-specific ESRS related to that matter.’
ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement E2-4 paragraph 28 requires undertakings to disclose pollutants
emitted to air, water and soil.
ESRS E2 paragraph 41 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose any relevant contextual information
including a description of material incidents and deposits whereby pollution had negative impacts
on the environment and/or is expected to have negative effects on the undertaking’s financial
cash flows, financial position and financial performance with short-, medium- and long-term time
horizons.’
ESRS E2 paragraph 28 (a) further addresses disclosures on pollutants by referencing relevant
regulation: ‘disclose the amounts of ... each pollutant listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No
166/2006 ... emitted to air, water and soil.’ To this end, the European Pollutant Release and
Transfer Register (E-PRTR) Regulation mentions ‘spilling’ as a particular type of pollutant ‘release’
(Article 2 (10)). Article 5 (2) of E-PRTR Regulation specifies that operators have to ‘include
information on releases and transfers resulting as totals of all deliberate, accidental, routine and
non-routine activities.’
Spills are not, however, an issue addressed by ESRS E2 disclosure only. Under the section
‘Interaction with other ESRS’, ESRS E2 paragraph 7 and 8 make clear its interaction with other
environmental and social topics. As an example, ESRS E2 paragraph 7 (c) indicates ‘Pollution as a
direct impact driver of biodiversity loss’ (ESRS E4) when considering other environmental impacts,
and ESRS E4 (biodiversity and ecosystem) refers to ‘Spills of polluting effluents’ as an example of
policy transition risk (E4-IRO-1 paragraph AR9 (b)(i)).
Oil spills also have social implications, and ‘incidents’ and ‘spills’ are referred to in ESRS S1-SBM-
3 paragraph 14 (b), ESRS S2-SBM-3 paragraph 11 (c), and ESRS S3-SBM-3 paragraph 9 (b). These
paragraphs indicate the requirements to disclose on the social implications of spillages, in
addition to the environmental ones in E2, in alignment with the principle that ESRS mutually
interact with one another.
ESRS 2 paragraph 61 states: ‘The corresponding disclosures shall be located alongside disclosures
prescribed by the relevant ESRS. When a single policy or the same actions address several
interconnected sustainability matters, the undertaking may disclose the required information in
its reporting under one topical ESRS and cross reference to it in its reporting under other topical
ESRS.’
Answer
Where spills can result in material pollution-related impacts, undertakings shall provide
disclosure in accordance with the provisions of ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 162 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
IRO-1 (materiality assessment) and ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement E2-1 (policies), E2-2 (actions)
and E2-3 (targets).
Concerning quantitative information on oil and chemical spills, undertakings shall also disclose
metrics by reporting on chemical releases to air, water and soil as prescribed by ESRS E2
Disclosure Requirement E2-4, referring to the E-PRTR (European Pollutant Release and Transfer
Register) Regulation, which mentions ‘spilling’ as a particular type of pollutant ‘release’ in Art. 2
(10). In this regard, undertakings are also to provide complementary contextual information on
incidents if these had negative environmental impacts and whenever they resulted in, or are
expected to have, (material) financial effects (ESRS Disclosure Requirement E2-6 paragraph 41).
If applicable, undertakings shall develop entity-specific metrics, too, in accordance with ESRS 1
paragraph 11 and ESRS 2 Metrics MDR-M.
Furthermore, spills can have material adverse impacts on water availability, ecosystems and
human health. Therefore, undertakings shall report those impacts in accordance with the relevant
disclosures under ESRS E3, ESRS E4, ESRS S1, ESRS S2, and ESRS S3 if material.
Reporting the impacts of spills under the several aforementioned ESRS topics may result in
undertakings needing to work with different metrics; for example: for pollution, amounts of
pollutants; for biodiversity, metrics that measure changes in the number of individuals of a
species; for own workforce, the number of fatalities or number of days lost to work-related
injuries or ill health; etc. Currently, there are no specific metrics concerning spills in the sector-
agnostic ESRS, nor are there requirements related to the spillage of complex substances that may
trigger pollution through different types of pollutants. The forthcoming sector standards may
develop sector-specific disclosures related to spills.
In terms of the presentation of disclosures, the undertaking can first provide specific information
within the scope of one topical standard (e.g., pollution), then cross-reference this information
to other interconnected topical standards (e.g., ESRS E4, S1) when addressing sustainability
matters that are interconnected (ESRS 2 paragraph 61).

Question ID 440 - Pollutants emissions – disaggregation
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
The amount of each pollutant to air, water and soil shall be consolidated over the facilities. Does
this mean one single/consolidated value for each pollutant into all categories? Or does this mean
one value for emissions into air, one value for emissions into water and one for emissions into
soil?

ESRS reference
ESRS E2 paragraphs 28 (a), 29, and AR 22
Key terms
Pollutant disaggregation
Background
ESRS E2-4 paragraph 28 (a) states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the amounts of . . . each
pollutant listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register “E-PRTR Regulation”) emitted to
air, water and soil, with the exception of emissions of GHGs which are disclosed in accordance
with ESRS E1 Climate Change’.
ESRS E2-4 paragraph 29 states: ‘The amounts referred in paragraph 28 shall be consolidated
amounts including the emissions from those facilities over which the undertaking has financial
control and those over which it has operational control. The consolidation shall include only the
emissions from facilities for which the applicable threshold value specified in Annex II of
Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 is exceeded’.
ESRS E2-4 paragraph AR 22 states: ‘The information required under this Disclosure Requirement
shall be provided at the level of the reporting undertaking. However, the undertaking may
disclose additional breakdown including information at site level or a breakdown of its emissions
by type of source, by sector or by geographical area’.
Regulation (EC) No 166/2006, Article 5 (1)(a) on ‘Reporting by operators’: ‘The operator of each
facility that undertakes one or more of the activities specified in Annex I above the applicable
capacity thresholds specified therein shall report the amounts annually to its competent
authority, along with an indication of whether the information is based on measurement,
calculation or estimation, of . . . releases to air, water and land of any pollutant specified in Annex
II for which the applicable threshold value specified in Annex II is exceeded’.
Answer
In line with the reporting requirements according to the E-PRTR Regulation, undertakings are to
disclose the emissions of each pollutant as separate annual amounts for each environmental
medium, i.e. released to air, released to water and released to soil. Consolidation refers to the
aggregation of pollutant emissions across the different facilities that the undertaking financially
or operationally controls (ESRS E2 paragraph 29). The consolidation shall include only the
emissions from facilities for which the applicable threshold value specified in Annex II of
Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 is exceeded.
The following example illustrates an undertaking that operates two industrial facilities in which
the threshold values specified in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 are exceeded:
Pollutant Releases to air Releases to water Releases to soil/land*

the disclosures required by ESRS E2 paragraph 28 (a).
In the example, the nitrogen oxide and chlorides represent the consolidated amount from the two
facilities.
An undertaking may also disclose additional breakdowns of its emissions by type of source, by
sector or by geographical area (ESRS E2 paragraph AR22 and ESRS 1 chapter 3.7 Level of
disaggregation).

Key terms
Microplastics
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 165 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Background
ESRS E2-4 paragraph 28 (b) states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the amounts of . . . microplastics
generated or used by the undertaking’.
ESRS E2-4 paragraph AR 20 states: ‘The information to be provided on microplastics under
paragraph 28 (b) shall include microplastics that have been generated or used during production
processes or that are procured, and that leave the undertaking’s facilities as emissions, as
products, or as part of products or services. Microplastics may be unintentionally produced when
larger pieces of plastics like car tires or synthetic textiles wear and tear or may be deliberately
manufactured and added to products for specific purposes (e.g., exfoliating beads in facial or body
scrubs).’
Answer
If material, an undertaking is to provide, as a minimum, information on the microplastics amounts
that it generates or uses. These refer to intentional or unintentional generation or use, both
through production processes and procurement. For reporting purposes, microplastics leaving the
facilities of the undertaking in the form of products, parts of products or services, or emissions
are to be considered. Microplastics that stay within the facilities, that are used in production
processes and that represent inventory used for business processes need not be reported, as they
do not leave the facilities.
Legislation on the matter of microplastics is currently evolving; hence, more defined requirements
may be expected in the future.
Question ID 619 – Air emissions in ESRS E2 versus ESRS E1

If the matter of GHG emissions is material, should the undertaking also report under the ESRS E2
in addition to ESRS E1?
ESRS Reference
E2 paragraph 28 (a)
Key terms
Non-GHG emission; ozone-depleting substance; air pollution
Background
To better address the issue pointed out by the submitter, it was agreed to revise the question
received, ‘If I have a material topic regarding GHG emissions, do I need to report under the E2
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 166 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Standard, or is E2 just for non-GHG gases since GHGs are disclosed in accordance with E1 Climate
Change?’ to the question above.
ESRS E2 paragraph 28 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the amounts of … (a) each pollutant …
emitted to air, water and soil, with the exception of emissions of GHGs which are disclosed in
accordance with ESRS E1 Climate Change’. The related footnote (65) refers to information derived
from the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, supplementing Regulation (EU)
2019/2088 (SFDR), including ‘indicator #3 in Table II of Annex I (“Emissions of ozone- depleting
substances”)’. ESRS E2, Basis for Conclusions, ‘EU legislation and policies alignment’, paragraph
BC16 specifies that the aforementioned SFRD PAI indicator is a ‘European framework reference’
to be used when disclosing under ESRS E2-4.
ESRS E2 paragraph 7 states: ‘ … to provide a comprehensive overview of what could be material
to pollution, relevant Disclosure Requirements are covered in other environmental Standards as
follows: (a) ESRS E1 Climate change which addresses the following seven greenhouse gases
connected to air pollution: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen
trifluoride (NF3)’.
ESRS E1 paragraph 4 states: ‘This Standard covers disclosure requirements related but not limited
to the seven Greenhouse gases (GHG): carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen
trifluoride (NF3) …’.
While defining ‘Greenhouse Gases (GHG), ESRS Annex II also provides an indication of the source
(Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action) to consult for a detailed
account of GHGs and therefore those that fall under the ESRS E1 domain: ‘The gases listed in Part
2 of Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13).
These include Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Sulphur hexafluoride
(SF6), Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)’.
ESRS E1 paragraph 8 states: ‘Ozone-depleting substances (ODS), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and
sulphur oxides (SOX), among other air emissions, are connected to climate change but are
covered under the reporting requirements in ESRS E2’.
‘Ozone-depleting substances’ are defined in ESRS Annex II as ‘Substances listed in the Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’. The Montreal Protocol identifies the
individual ‘controlled substances’ with a high ozone-depleting potential (ODP). Such substances
are considered substances of concern (SoC) under ESRS, as per the definition of SoC in Annex II,
which includes, among others, substances that are ‘hazardous to the ozone layer’. SoC are to be
disclosed on across the ESRS E2 Standard (E2-1, E2-2, E2-3, E2-5, E2-6).
The ESRS E2 Basis for Conclusions discusses the consistency with GRI’s metrics on ODS and air
emissions under paragraph BC39 for Disclosure Requirement E2-4 as well as alignment with WHO
Global Air Quality Guidelines, which additionally incorporate fine (‘PM₂.₅’) and inhalable
particulate matter (‘PM₁₀’), Ozone(O₃), nitrogen dioxide (‘NO₂’), Sulphur dioxide (‘SO₂’) and carbon
monoxide (‘CO’), and qualitative good practice statements for certain types of particulate matter.
ESRS E2 paragraph 24 states: ’In addition to ESRS 2 MDR-T, the undertaking may specify whether
ecological thresholds (e.g. the biosphere integrity, stratospheric ozone-depletion, atmospheric
aerosol loading, soil depletion, ocean acidification) and entity-specific allocations were taken into
consideration when setting targets.’
IG 1 Materiality Assessment paragraph 46 states: ‘Once a matter has been identified as material,
the undertaking refers to the DR in the respective topical ESRS to identify the information to be
disclosed on the matter … Similarly, if an undertaking concludes that pollution of water is material,
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 167 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
it shall provide information under the DR in ESRS E2-1 Policies, E2-2 Actions and resources, E2-3
Targets, E2-4 Pollution of air, water and soil and E2-6 Anticipated financial effects from material
polluted-related risks and opportunities’.
Answer
When GHG emissions are material, the undertaking will report them under ESRS E1. If other air
emissions (i.e. non-GHG emissions) are material, then the undertaking will need to report those
under ESRS E2.
Under ESRS, GHGs include seven types, which are CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, NF3, HFCs, and PFCs. GHG
emissions are covered by ESRS E1 and should therefore be reported in accordance with it. All other
air emissions – including, therefore, non-GHG discharges – are to be reported in accordance with
ESRS E2. Among such air pollutants are ozone-depleting substances (ODS), nitrogen oxides (NOX)
and sulphur oxides (SOX). Undertakings may refer to the E-PRTR for the other air pollutants.
It is to be noted that the reporting of non-GHG emissions is pervasive across all ESRS E2 Disclosure
Requirements (from E2-1 to E2-6).

Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 25 states: ‘Performing a materiality assessment (see sections 3.4 Impact
materiality and 3.5 Financial materiality) is necessary for the undertaking to identify the material
impacts, risks and opportunities to be reported’.
IG 1 Materiality assessment paragraph 27 states: ‘ESRS 1 sets criteria for the materiality
assessment, but not specific thresholds to determine when a matter or information is material or
not. Therefore, the assessment requires the exercise of judgement. The undertaking needs to set
thresholds based on the ESRS 1 criteria as well as its own specific facts and circumstances …’.
ESRS E2-4 paragraph 28 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the amounts of … (b) microplastics

ESRS E2-4 paragraph AR 20 states: ‘The information to be provided on microplastics under
paragraph 28(b) shall include microplastics that have been generated or used during production
processes or that are procured, and that leave the undertaking’s facilities as emissions, as
products, or as part of products or services. Microplastics may be unintentionally produced when
larger pieces of plastics like car tires or synthetic textiles wear and tear or may be deliberately
manufactured and added to products for specific purposes (e.g. exfoliating beads in facial or body
scrubs).’
IG 2 Value Chain paragraph 185 states for ESRS E2-4: ‘AR 20 refers to procurement of
microplastics’.
Answer
It depends on the outcome of the undertaking’s materiality assessment, including how it applies
appropriate thresholds to determine the information it discloses on metrics (see ESRS 1 paragraph
34).
The materiality assessment of microplastics should cover the whole value chain, including but not
limited to own operations (see also ESRS E2 AR 20), and cover both primary microplastics
(designed to be used in products or manufacturing) and secondary microplastics (generated from
the breakdown of larger plastics, e.g. tires).
If the undertaking identifies microplastics as a material topic in its value chain, e.g. the
downstream value chain, it shall provide, if needed (see ESRS 1 paragraphs 11 and AR 1 to 5),
additional disclosures on an entity-specific basis to enable users to understand its impacts, risks
and opportunities (see also IG 2: Value Chain paragraph 185).
If material, then according to ESRS E2-4 undertakings are to report on the amounts of
microplastics that are unintentionally generated when larger pieces of plastics, such as car tires,
wear and tear.
Please refer to ID 411 Microplastics for further clarifications on the value chain coverage.

Annex II Glossary and Acronyms of Terms defines ‘microplastics’ as ‘Small pieces of plastics,
usually smaller than 5mm. A growing volume of microplastics is found in the environment,
including the sea, and in food and drinking water. Once in the environment, microplastics do not
biodegrade and tend to accumulate, unless they are specifically designed to biodegrade in the
open environment. Biodegradability is a complex phenomenon, especially in the marine
environment. There are increasing concerns about the presence of microplastics in different
environment compartments (such as water), their impact on the environment and potentially
human health’.

has taken place in nature, independently of the process through which they have been extracted,
which are not chemically modified substances; (b) polymers that are degradable as proved in
accordance with Appendix 15; (c) polymers that have a solubility greater than 2 g/L as proved in
accordance with Appendix 16; (d) polymers that do not contain carbon atoms in their chemical
structure’.
Regulation (EU) 2023/2055, recital 18, explains that ‘derogations from the ban on placing on the
market are proposed where the risk from releases is expected to be minimised because synthetic
polymer microparticles are contained by technical means, such as those in chromatography
columns, water filtering cartridges or printer toners, or permanently lose their particle form
because, for example, they swell or form a film, like in diapers, nail polish or paint, or are
permanently enclosed in a solid matrix during end use, such as fibres added to concrete or pellets
used as feedstock for moulded articles’.
Regulation (EU) 2023/2055, Annex XVII, entry 78 of Column 2, paragraphs 4 and 5 clarify the
abovementioned exceptions to the scope of the market ban of certain microplastics: ‘4.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the placing on the market of: (a) synthetic polymer microparticles,
as substances on their own or in mixtures, for use at industrial sites; (b) medicinal products within
the scope of Directive 2001/83/EC and veterinary medicinal products within the scope of
Regulation (EU) 2019/6 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*1); (c) EU fertilising
products within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (*2); (d) food additives within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (*3); (e) in vitro diagnostic devices, including devices within the
scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*4); (f) food
within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, not covered by point (d) of this
paragraph, and feed as defined in Article 3(4) of that Regulation. 5. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to
the placing on the market of the following synthetic polymer microparticles, as substances on
their own or in mixtures: (a) synthetic polymer microparticles which are contained by technical
means so that releases to the environment are prevented when used in accordance with the
instructions for use during the intended end use; (b) synthetic polymer microparticles the physical
properties of which are permanently modified during intended end use in such a way that the
polymer no longer falls within the scope of this entry; (c) synthetic polymer microparticles which
are permanently incorporated into a solid matrix during intended end use.’
Regulation (EU) 2023/2055, recital 2, states that ‘A big part of microplastic pollution forms
unintentionally, for example as a result of the breakdown of larger pieces of plastic waste, or the
wear and tear of tyres and road paint, or the washing of synthetic clothes. However, tiny

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
fragments of synthetic or chemically-modified natural polymers are also manufactured to be
used as such or added to products’.
Answer
The definition of microplastics to use in ESRS reporting is that of the Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 (Annex II and Disclosure Requirement ESRS E2-4 paragraph AR 20).
The aspects that are key to the ESRS definition of ‘microplastics’ are size (pieces of plastics, usually
smaller than 5mm), the intentional or unintentional nature of their generation and impacts on
the environment and human health. The definition of microplastics in the ESRS does not reference
the REACH update (Regulation (EU) 2023/2055), which focuses more on the physical definition of
microplastics and provides a more extensive definition (at least 1 % by weight of the particles has:
1. dimensions ≤ 5mm or 2. particle length ≤ 15mm and length/diameter > 3 mm) than the one in
ESRS (particle dimensions ≤ 5mm).
Moreover, the REACH update is related to very specific uses of microplastics intentionally added
to products (REACH restrictions), while there are many other sources of microplastic releases
(both intentional and unintentional) into the environment, which the definition under ESRS
focuses on. Triggering for ESRS reporting are those microplastics that leave the undertaking’s
facilities as emissions, products or parts of products or services, which is when the ESRS stipulate
that they must be reported by the undertaking if material. Microplastics that leave the facilities
as part of products should include those that are released to the environment, either due to wear
and tear by product use (e.g. car tires or synthetic textiles) or due to the fact that they were
manufactured to be added to products for specific purposes (e.g. exfoliating beads in facial or
body scrubs).
Finally, the REACH update presents additional criteria under which microplastics in products are
not to be considered pollutants (mainly referring to the use of microplastics as material input for
certain sectors and polymer characteristics).
It is to be noted that legislation on the matter of microplastics is currently evolving; hence, more
defined requirements may be expected in the future.

Question asked
How can preparers take ‘the changes over time’ into account when disclosing the amounts of
pollutants?
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 172 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS Reference
ESRS E2 paragraph 30 (a)
Key terms
Pollution; microplastics
Background
ESRS E2 paragraph 30 states: ‘The undertaking shall put its disclosure into context and describe:
(a) the changes over time …’.
ESRS E2 paragraph AR 25 states: ‘Where the undertaking’s activities are subject to Directive
2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions (IED) (67) and
relevant Best Available Techniques Reference Documents (BREFs), irrespective of whether the
activity takes place within the European Union or not, the undertaking may disclose the following
additional information’.
ESRS E4 paragraph 38 states: ‘The undertaking may disclose metrics that measure: …
(b) changes over time (e.g. 1 or 5 years) in the management of the ecosystem …’.
ESRS E4 paragraph AR 27 states: ‘When preparing the information required under this Disclosure
Requirement, the undertaking shall consider and may describe:
(a) the methodologies and metrics used and an explanation for why these methodologies and
metrics are selected, as well as their assumptions, limitations and uncertainties, and any
changes in methodologies made over time and why they occurred;...’
ESRS 1 paragraph 77 provides definitions of three main time intervals for the undertaking to adopt:
short-term, corresponding to the ‘reporting period in its financial statements’; medium-term,
lasting ‘from the end of the short-term reporting period … up to 5 years’; and long-term for periods
of ‘more than 5 years’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 74 states: ‘The undertaking shall establish appropriate linkages in its
sustainability statement between retrospective and forward-looking information, when relevant,
to foster a clear understanding of how historical information relates to future-oriented
information’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 83 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose comparative information in respect of
the previous period for all quantitative metrics and monetary amounts disclosed in the current
period.’
ESRS 2 Disclosure Requirement SBM-3 paragraph 48 (c) (iii) states that the undertaking shall
disclose ‘the reasonably expected time horizons of the impacts’.
Answer
The undertaking would be reflecting changes over time by disclosing for its quantitative metrics,
at the very least, comparative information in respect to the previous reporting period (see ESRS 1
paragraph 83). In this case, this means that the undertaking would, at the very least, disclose the
amount of pollutants of the current reporting year and the amount of pollutants reported for the
previous year (if reported) to describe changes in the amount. Should the measurement
methodologies or approaches for pollutant quantification have changed regarding the previous
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 173 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
reporting period, the undertaking may describe, if relevant, those methodology changes to help
understand the changes in the amount of pollutants disclosed (as recommended for E4-5
paragraph AR 27 (a)).
In addition, and in more generic terms, when disclosing the amounts of pollutants, preparers shall
consider the ESRS 1 paragraph 77 provision on establishing appropriate linkages with their
sustainability statements between past, present and future information when relevant to allow
for a better understandability of how its historical information relates to current and to future-
oriented information.
As no specific indication is provided on the type of changes that undertakings need to report
regarding pollutants’ emissions, an approach shall be selected that supports understandability
and comparability over time (see ESRS 1 Chapter 2 Qualitative characteristics of information) and
that considers the materiality of the pollution (materiality concept). Additionally, although no
specific example is provided for ESRS Disclosure Requirement E2-4, preparers may consider the
one given under ESRS Disclosure Requirement E4-5 for metrics on biodiversity, which suggests
looking into changes expressed as a variation from one year to the next (short-term) or in five-
year intervals (medium-term).
It is to be noted that the implementation of pollution prevention and pollution control measures,
and the adoption of BATs, can lead to significant changes over time of the amounts, types and
form of pollutant releases which provide relevant contextual information to the disclosure of
metrics.

Background
ID 226 and 301 were both on Substances of (Very High) Concern. As they have related answers,
they were combined in the questions above. To better answer the questions addressed by the
submitters, it was agreed to change the questions received from ID 226 ‘What is the difference
between ‘substances of concern’ and ‘substances of very high concern’ in ESRS E2 Disclosure
Requirement E2-5?’ and ID 301 ‘What is the list of substances of high concern to be considered?
Is the list of substances of Very High Concern the one in Annex XIV of REACH? What are the main
hazard classes of substances of concern and very high concern that must be considered for
reporting under paragraph 34?’ to the questions above.
As per Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms, a substance of concern (SoC) is a ‘substance that
meets at least one of three criteria:’
(1) ‘meets the criteria laid down in Article 57 and is identified in accordance with Article 59
(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(REACH) – this group of substances corresponds to Substances of Very High Concern;
(2) is classified in Part 3 (which lists hazardous substances for which harmonised
classification and labelling have been established at Community level) of Annex VI
(Harmonised classification and labelling for certain hazardous substances) to Regulation
(EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (Regulation on
classification, labelling and packaging (CLP) of substances) in one of the following hazard
classes or hazard categories:
(a) carcinogenicity categories 1 and 2;
(b) germ cell mutagenicity categories 1 and 2;
(c) reproductive toxicity categories 1 and 2;
(d) endocrine disruption for human health;
(e) endocrine disruption for the environment;
(f) Persistent, Mobile and Toxic or Very Persistent, Very Mobile properties;
(g) Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic or Very Persistent, Very Bioaccumulative
properties;
(h) respiratory sensitisation category 1;
(i) skin sensitisation category 1;
(j) chronic hazard to the aquatic environment categories 1 to 4;
(k) hazardous to the ozone layer;
(l) specific target organ toxicity, repeated exposure categories 1 and 2;
(m) specific target organ toxicity, single exposure categories 1 and 2;
(3) or negatively affects the re-use and recycling of materials in the product in which it is
present, as defined in relevant Union product-specific ecodesign requirements.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 175 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
The ESRS Glossary defines substances of very high concern (SVHCs) as substances ‘that meet the
criteria laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH)’ and that are ‘identified
in accordance with Article 59 (1) of that Regulation’.
Following Article 57 of REACH, the substances described below may be identified as SVHC:
(a) under the Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP) as: (a) carcinogenic of category 1A and 1B;
(b) mutagenic category 1A and 1B; (c) toxic for reproduction category 1A and 1B;
(b) under Annex XIII of REACH as: d) persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic; e) very persistent
and very bioaccumulative;
(c) other substances for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to
human health or the environment, which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to
those other substances listed above, and which are identified on a case-by-case basis,
such as those having endocrine disrupting properties.
The list that is relevant for the identification of SVHCs is the ‘Candidate List of substances of very
high concern for Authorisation’, which compiles the list of substances that are potential
candidates for inclusion in Annex XIV (Authorisation list).
Concerning SoCs, these will include the SVHCs in the lists above (criterion 1) as well as all
substances corresponding to criterion 2 – but for which, at this stage, a comprehensive list cannot
be presented. Nevertheless, substances regulated under CLP would have information that could
allow their assessment as being SoCs. Furthermore, ECHA provides a database to filter Annex VI
by specific hazard classes: the C&L Inventory. As to criterion 3, it is still not yet fully regulated and,
hence, there is currently no specific list of chemicals for these criteria. However, ESRS 1 paragraph
11 states that ‘… when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered
or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and
circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand
the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities.’ Additionally, existing
standard product specification from CEN/CENELEC, academic literature or other sources could
provide valuable guidance to assess the risks of use of certain substances in products that may
potentially fall within criterion 3; nonetheless, no list can be provided at this stage.
Answer
(1) What is the difference between ‘substances of concern’ (SoCs) and ‘substances of very
high concern’ (SVHCs) in ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement E2-5?
As per the ESRS Glossary in Annex II of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772,
Substances of Concern constitute a broader group of substances, including:
(a) the Substances of Very High Concern meeting the criteria laid down in Art. 57 and 59 of
the REACH regulation;
(b) the substances classified in one of the hazard classes or hazard categories, as per point
(ii) of the definition of SoC in the ESRS Glossary (see 'Background' information), and as
listed in Part 3 (Table 3.1) of Annex VI of CLP;
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 176 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(c) and substances that negatively affect the reuse and recycling of materials in the products
in which they are present, as defined in the relevant EU product-specific ecodesign
requirements (forthcoming).
(2) What are the lists of substances of concern (SoC) and substances of very high concern
(SVHC) to be considered?
The list of substances covered by point (a) is available by consulting the ‘Candidate List of
substances of very high concern for Authorisation’ managed by the European Chemicals Agency
(ECHA), pursuant to Article 59 (10) of the REACH Regulation.
The list of substances covered by point (b) is available by consulting the table of harmonised
entries in Annex VI to CLP, containing all updates3 to the harmonised classification and labelling
of hazardous substances, which are available in Table 3 of Annex VI to the CLP Regulation,
managed by the ECHA. The ECHA also provides a database (C&L Inventory) to filter Annex VI by
specific hazard classes.
As for point (c), currently there are no Union product-specific ecodesign requirements available;
hence, there are no published lists for these substances. Nonetheless, undertakings are to follow
ESRS 1 indications on entity-specific disclosures should they conclude that a related impact, risk
or opportunity is material although not explicitly covered by the ESRS.
(3) What are their respective main hazard classes?
Undertakings may refer to the regulatory sources – the REACH and CLP regulations – to identify
information on the definitions and lists of substances as well as for further indications on hazard
classes. Please also see background information.
Please also refer to explanations ID 186 and ID 226 for further information on Substances of (Very
High) Concern.
Lastly, please also refer to ID 186 for further information on Substances of (Very High) Concern.

If a company sells articles containing substances of (very high) concern, shall the total amounts
of products containing those substances or the total amounts of substances within those products
be reported?
ESRS Reference
ESRS paragraph 34
Key terms
Substances of concern; substances of very high concern; SoC; SVHC
Background
To better address the issue addressed by the submitter, it was agreed to change the question
received from ‘If a company sells articles containing substances of concern and substances of very
high concern, shall the total amount of the products containing those substances be reported or
the total amount of the substances within those products?’ to the question above.
E2-5 paragraph 34 concerns the production and procurement of substances of concern, including
when these leave the facilities of the manufacturing undertaking as products as well as ‘… total
amounts of substances of concern that are generated or used during the production or that are
procured, and the total amounts of substances of concern that leave its facilities as emissions, as
products, or as part of products or services split into main hazard classes of substances of
concern’.
E2-5 paragraph 32 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose information on the production, use,
distribution, commercialisation and import/export of substances of concern and substances of
very high concern, on their own, in mixtures or in articles’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures’.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 178 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
The undertaking is in any case required to provide information on the total amounts of substances
of concern within those products if it concludes that pollution is material. In addition, depending
on its specific circumstances, the undertaking may conclude that it is also material to disclose the
amounts of products containing such substances.
Under ESRS E2-5 paragraph 34, the undertaking that produces, uses, distributes, commercialises
and imports/exports substances of concern and substances of very high concern on their own, in
mixtures or in articles shall disclose ‘the total amounts of substances of concern that are
generated or used during the production or that are procured, and the total amounts of
substances of concern that leave its facilities as emissions, as products, or as part of products or
services split into main hazard classes of substances of concern.’
Nonetheless, if the undertaking concludes that additional entity-specific metrics (including in
connection to its value chain) are needed due to the related impacts, risks or opportunities not
being covered or not being covered with sufficient granularity by the required metric in ESRS E2-
5 and that these entity-specific metrics are related to the total amount of products containing
substances of concern and substances of very high concern, then it has to include also that
information in its reporting.

ESRS E2 paragraph AR 13 states: ‘Where actions extend to upstream or downstream value chain
engagements, the undertaking shall provide information on the types of actions reflecting these
engagements.’
ESRS E2 paragraph AR 19 states: ‘The targets may cover the undertaking’s own operations and/or
the value chain.’
ESRS E2 paragraph AR 28 states: ‘In order for the information to be complete, substances in the
undertaking’s own operations and those procured shall be included (e.g. embedded in ingredients,
semi-finished products, or the final product).’
ESRS 1 paragraph 71 states: ‘With reference to policies, actions and targets, the undertaking’s
reporting shall include upstream and/or downstream value chain information to the extent that
those policies, actions and targets involve actors in the value chain. With reference to metrics, in
many cases, in particular for environmental matters for which proxies are available, the
undertaking may be able to comply with the reporting requirements without collecting data from
the actors in its upstream and downstream value chain, especially from SMEs, for example, when
calculating the undertaking’s GHG Scope 3 emissions’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability
matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the
undertaking: …
(b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH), Article 3 defines ‘article’ as 'an object which during
production is given a special shape, surface or design which determines its function to a greater
degree than does its chemical composition’. Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH), Article 33 on
the ‘Duty to communicate information on substances in articles’ states: ‘1. Any supplier of an
article containing a substance meeting the criteria in Article 57 and identified in accordance with
Article 59(1) in a concentration above 0,1 % weight by weight (w/w) shall provide the recipient of
the article with sufficient information, available to the supplier, to allow safe use of the article
including, as a minimum, the name of that substance. 2. On request by a consumer, any supplier
of an article containing a substance meeting the criteria in Article 57 and identified in accordance
with Article 59(1) in a concentration above 0,1 % weight by weight (w/w) shall provide the
consumer with sufficient information, available to the supplier, to allow safe use of the article
including, as a minimum, the name of that substance’.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 180 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
If substances of concern (and/or substances of very high concern) in articles represent a material
topic for the undertaking:
(a) for the metrics disclosure of ESRS E2 paragraphs 34 and 35, the undertaking shall consider
both those within its production processes as well as the ones entering its own operations
through procurement as an ingredient, semi-finished products, or final products. If the
metric cannot be determined through direct data collection, e.g. by obtaining it from
suppliers, after making a reasonable effort to do so, it shall be estimated by using proxies.
Reference is made to ‘ID 504 – Disclosure Requirements on material metrics when
information is not available; and
(b) the undertaking shall, in any case, report on the related policies, actions and targets
(PAT) it has in place in relation to the material topic. ESRS E2 provides in particular specific
indications on the extension of the reporting under the PAT to the value chain.
Concerning policies, the undertaking must disclose whether and how its policies support
the substitution and minimisation of the use of substances of concern. This information
is to be provided also for its upstream and downstream value chain. With regard to
actions, undertakings shall report on upstream and downstream value chain
engagements when present. The extension of targets to value chain entities is, however,
optional.
Concerning the specific case of substances of very high concern (SVHC) in articles, Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006 (REACH) requires communicating SVHC content where specific thresholds are
exceeded.
To note: Information to be collected from value chain entities can be omitted during a three-year
phase-in period if certain conditions are met in accordance with ESRS 1 Chapter 10.2 Transitional
provision related to Chapter 5 Value chain, unless it is prescribed under EU legislation.
See [Draft] Question 29 ESRS require undertakings to use estimates if they cannot obtain all
necessary value chain information after having made reasonable efforts to do so (ESRS 1 General
requirements paragraph 69). What constitutes ‘reasonable effort’? from the European
Commission on the interpretation of certain legal provisions in Directive 2013/34/EU (Accounting
Directive).

When are incidents and deposits considered to be ‘major’? Is there a qualitative or quantitative
threshold to consider?
ESRS reference
ESRS E2 paragraph 40 (b)
Key terms
Anticipated financial effect; major incident; deposit
Background
ESRS E2 paragraph 38 states: ‘The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an
understanding of:
(a) anticipated financial effects due to material risks arising from pollution-related impacts
and dependencies and how those risks have (or could reasonably be expected to have) a
material influence on the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance, and
cash flows, over the short-, medium- and long term- …’.
ESRS E2 paragraph 39 states: ‘The disclosure shall include:
(a) a quantification of the anticipated financial effects in monetary terms before considering
pollution-related actions, or where not possible without undue cost or effort, qualitative
information.’
ESRS E2 paragraph 40 states: ‘The information provided under paragraph 39 (a) shall include …
(b) operating and capital expenditures incurred in the reporting period in conjunction with
major incidents and deposits’.
ESRS E2 paragraph 15 states: ‘The undertaking shall indicate, with regard to its own operations
and its upstream and downstream value chain, whether and how its policies address the following
areas where material … (c) avoiding incidents and emergency situations’.
ESRS E2 paragraph 41 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose any relevant contextual information
including a description of material incidents and deposits whereby pollution had negative impacts
on the environment and/or is expected to have negative effects on the undertaking’s financial
cash flows, financial position and financial performance with short-, medium- and long-term time
horizons’.
The Industrial Emissions Directive, recital 16, stipulates that ‘The impact of pollution, including
when caused by incidents or accidents, can extend beyond the territory of a Member State. In
such cases, without prejudice to Directive 2012/18/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council (9), limiting the consequences for human health and the environment of incidents or
accidents and preventing further possible incidents or accidents requires prompt exchange of
information and close coordination between the competent authorities of the Member States
which are or could be affected by such events. Therefore, in the event of any incident or accident
significantly affecting the environment or human health in another Member State, exchange of
information and transboundary and multidisciplinary cooperation between the affected Member
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 182 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
States should be fostered to limit the consequences for the environment and human health and
to prevent further possible incidents or accidents’.
The Industrial Emissions Directive, Article 7(b), adds that ‘in the event of any incident or accident
significantly affecting the environment …the operator immediately takes the measures to limit the
consequences for human health or the environment and to prevent further possible incidents or
accidents’.
The Seveso-III Directive, Article 3, paragraph 13 defines a major accident as ‘an occurrence such
as a major emission, fire, or explosion resulting from uncontrolled developments in the course of
the operation of any establishment covered by this Directive, and leading to serious danger to
human health or the environment, immediate or delayed, inside or outside the establishment,
and involving one or more dangerous substances’.
Answer
ESRS do not provide a threshold for distinguishing major incidents and deposits from regular
occurrences. The evaluation of incidents should, in all cases, be based on the undertaking’s
materiality assessment and incidents identified as major are likely connected to material impacts
and risks and, therefore, likely to be identified as material. At the same time, incidents of lower
scale can carry material impacts or financial risks and, therefore, be assessed by the undertaking
as material, too.
It is also to be noted that based on the provisions of materiality of information of ESRS 1
paragraph 34, the disclosure of operating and capital expenditures incurred in the reporting
period, in conjunction with major incidents and deposits as required by ESRS E2 paragraph 40 (b),
depends more on whether the expenditures are financially material and not on what kind of
major incidents or deposits caused them.
The undertaking may also need to consider the provisions in the Seveso-III Directive on major
accidents as well as those in the IED 2.0 on incidents and accidents that significantly affect the
environment. The IED stipulates in particular that incidents or accident may significantly affect
the environment and may become a national matter or even extend beyond national borders.
The Seveso-III Directive (used in the development of ESRS E2) explicitly defines major accidents
and includes examples that can be considered for reporting. In the cases in which an
undertaking’s incidents or accidents fall within the scope of major or significant incidents or
accidents according to existing law (i.e. IED 2.0 and Seveso-III Directive), such incidents and
accidents would also be considered as major incidents according to ESRS. Should any of the
undertaking’s facilities or installations not be covered by the IED 2.0 or the Seveso-III Directive,
the undertaking can nonetheless consider the definitions provided in those Directives when
applying its materiality assessment.

Question asked
What is the meaning of water treatment ‘as a step towards more sustainable sourcing of water’?
ESRS Reference
ESRS E3 paragraph 12 (a) (ii)
Key terms
Water management; water policies; water treatment
Background
ESRS E3 paragraph 12 states: ‘The undertaking shall indicate whether and how its policies address
the following matters where material:
(a) water management including: …
ii. water treatment as a step towards more sustainable sourcing of water; …’
In Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms wastewater is defined as ‘Water which is of no further
immediate value to the purpose for which it was used or in the pursuit of which it was produced
because of its quality, quantity, or time of occurrence. Wastewater from one user can be a
potential supply to a user elsewhere …’.
US EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse reads: ‘Direct potable reuse (DPR): The introduction of
reclaimed water (with or without retention in an engineered storage buffer) directly into a
drinking water treatment plant, either collocated or remote from the advanced wastewater
treatment system. Indirect potable reuse (IPR): Augmentation of a drinking water source (surface
or groundwater) with reclaimed water followed by an environmental buffer that precedes
drinking water treatment. Nonpotable reuse: All water reuse applications that do not involve
potable reuse. Potable reuse: Planned augmentation of a drinking water supply with reclaimed
water … Water reuse: The use of treated municipal wastewater (reclaimed water) … Reclaimed
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 184 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
water: Municipal wastewater that has been treated to meet specific water quality criteria with
the intent of being used for a range of purposes. The term recycled water is synonymous with
reclaimed water. Water reclamation: The act of treating municipal wastewater to make it
acceptable for reuse.’
Regulation 2020/741/EU on minimum requirements for water reuse, paragraph (2), reads: ‘The
Union’s ability to respond to the increasing pressures on water resources could be improved by
wider reuse of treated waste water, limiting extraction from surface water bodies and
groundwater bodies, reducing the impact of discharge of treated waste water into water bodies,
and promoting water savings through multiple uses for urban waste water, while ensuring a high
level of environmental protection. ’
Paragraph (6) states: ‘In its communication of 2 December 2015 “Closing the loop – An EU action
plan for the Circular Economy”, the Commission committed to taking a series of actions to
promote the reuse of treated waste water, including the development of a legislative proposal
on minimum requirements for water reuse.’
Paragraph (9) states: ‘Reuse of properly treated waste water, for example from urban waste
water treatment plants, is considered to have a lower environmental impact than other
alternative water supply methods, such as water transfers or desalination.’
The definition in Article 3 of ‘reclaimed water’ reads as follows: ‘(4) “reclaimed water” means
urban waste water that has been treated in compliance with the requirements set out in Directive
91/271/EEC and which results from further treatment in a reclamation facility in accordance with
Section 2 of Annex I to this Regulation …’.
Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste water treatment, Article 2, reads: ‘For the purpose of this
Directive:
7. “primary treatment” means treatment of urban waste water by a physical and/or chemical
process involving settlement of suspended solids, or other processes in which the BOD5 of the
incoming waste water is reduced by at least 20 % before discharge and the total suspended solids
of the incoming waste water are reduced by at least 50 %;
8. “secondary treatment” means treatment of urban waste water by a process generally involving
biological treatment with a secondary settlement or other process in which the requirements
established in Table 1 of Annex I are respected;
9. “appropriate treatment” means treatment of urban waste water by any process and/or
disposal system which after discharge allows the receiving waters to meet the relevant quality
objectives and the relevant provisions of this and other Community Directives …’.
The Circular Economy Action Plan 2020 states: ‘The new Water Reuse Regulation will encourage
circular approaches to water reuse in agriculture. The Commission will facilitate water reuse and
efficiency, including in industrial processes.’
In its article ‘Sustainability in Water Supply’, the International Water Association Publishing writes
on reclaimed water: ‘Reclaimed water, or water recycled from human use, can also be a
sustainable source of water supply. It is an important solution to reduce stress on primary water
resources such as surface and groundwater’.
Answer
There is no definition of water treatment or of sustainable sourcing of water in the Annex II
Acronyms and Glossary of terms. However, in the definition of wastewater the concept of water
reuse is introduced: ‘Wastewater from one user can be a potential supply to a user elsewhere’.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 185 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Only the use by external users is explicitly mentioned, while the possibility of internal reuse in the
undertaking’s own operation may also exist but is not made explicit. Even if not explicit in the
ESRS definition, wastewater in most cases will have to undergo treatment before it can be used
for a different purpose or reused for the same purpose.
Water treatment encompasses physical, chemical and biological treatments operated on water
outputs (or inputs) with the purpose of meeting adequate quality for a certain use, process or
destination, such as drinking water quality level, preparation for another use (industrial,
agricultural) or the discharge back to the natural environment.
Therefore, ESRS E3 paragraph 12 (a) (ii) should be read under the assumption that policies on
water treatment can promote water reuse as a sustainable source of water. In these terms, water
treatment can increase the sustainability of water management practices and, more specifically,
water sourcing to the extent that it can reduce the need for water withdrawal and therefore the
pressure on the water environment. It can also improve the quality of water discharges,
increasing the availability of high-quality, safe water for withdrawal and ecological functions. The
practice can more broadly be seen as an application of circular economy principles to water
management.

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 186 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
Water consumption; consolidated data; multiple sites
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 31 states: ‘The applicable information prescribed within a Disclosure
Requirement, including its datapoints, or an entity-specific disclosure shall be disclosed when the
undertaking assesses, as part of its assessment of material information, that the information is
relevant from one or more of the following perspectives:
(a) the significance of the information in relation to the matter it purports to depict or explain;
or
(b) the capacity of such information to meet the users’ decision-making needs, including the
needs of primary users of general-purpose financial reporting described in paragraph 48
and/or the needs of users whose principal interest is in information about the undertaking’s
impacts.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability
matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking:
(a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such
information to be material; and
(b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 54 states: ‘When needed for a proper understanding of its material impacts,
risks and opportunities, the undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information: (a) by
country, when there are significant variations of material impacts, risks and opportunities across
countries and when presenting the information at a higher level of aggregation would obscure
material information about impacts, risks or opportunities; or (b) by significant site or by
significant asset, when material impacts, risks and opportunities are highly dependent on a
specific location or asset.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 56 states: ‘Where data from different levels, or multiple locations within a level,
is aggregated, the undertaking shall ensure that this aggregation does not obscure the specificity
and context necessary to interpret the information. The undertaking shall not aggregate material
items that differ in nature.’.
ESRS 1 paragraph QC. 1 states: ‘Sustainability information is relevant when it may make a
difference in the decisions of users under a double materiality approach (see Chapter 3 of this
Standard).’
ESRS 1 pargraph QC. 5 states: ‘To be useful, the information must not only represent relevant
phenomena, it must also faithfully represent the substance of the phenomena that it purports to
represent. Faithful representation requires information to be (i) complete, (ii) neutral and (iii)
accurate.’

ESRS 2 paragraph 77 states: ‘For each metric, the undertaking shall: (a) disclose the methodologies
and significant assumptions behind the metric, including the limitations of the methodologies
used.’
ESRS E3 paragraph 26 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose information on its water
consumption performance related to its material impacts, risks and opportunities.’
ESRS E3 paragraph 28 states: ‘The disclosure required by paragraph 26 relates to own operations
and shall include:
(a) total water consumption in m3;
(b) total water consumption in m3 in areas at water risk, including areas of high-water stress;
(c) total water recycled and reused in m3;
(d) total water stored and changes in storage in m3; and
(e) any contextual information necessary regarding points (a) to (d), including the water basins’
water quality and quantity, how the data have been compiled, such as any standards,
methodologies, and assumptions used, including whether the information is calculated,
estimated, modelled, or sourced from direct measurements, and the approach taken for
this, such as the use of any sector-specific factors.’
ESRS E3 paragraph AR 1 states: ‘When conducting a materiality assessment on environmental
subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the materiality of water and marine resources in its own
operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, and may consider the four phases
below, also known as the LEAP approach: (a) Phase 1: locate where in its own operations and
along the value chain the interface with nature takes place …’.
Answer
ESRS E3 paragraph 28 requires the disclosure of water consumption related to own operations
and related contextual information. It is expected that all sites and their contextual information
are considered in the materiality assessment. The disclosures on water consumption and
contextual information shall be reported for the entire group and can be aggregated for all or for
multiple sites.
The undertaking can aggregate information, according to ESRS 1 paragraph 56, under the
condition that the aggregation does not obscure the specificity and context necessary to interpret
the information. The undertaking shall not aggregate material items that differ in nature. It is up
to the undertaking to decide the best way to do that aggregation, so as to not to obscure material
information and meet the qualitative characteristics of information as per ESRS 1 paragraph 19.
If an aggregated presentation fails to portray, in alignment with the qualitative characteristics of
information, the profile of water consumption of the group, the information shall be
disaggregated for material sites (or assets) in accordance with ESRS 1, paragraph 54(b). The
information to be disaggregated may refer to the water consumption metric, contextual
information or both.
As an example, an undertaking with several (e.g. one hundred) facilities in different water basins
may provide contextual information (e.g. in percentages) on how many of its facilities are located
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 188 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
in areas of high-water stress and how this is the underlying factor driving water consumption as a
material matter, as the risk of water droughts becoming more frequent can lead to more frequent
production stoppages constraining future production capacity. It may also have to provide the
location of facilities in areas of high-water stress or of areas of high-water stress where the
relevant facilities are located, if material.
The above answer does not address the omission of immaterial amounts, which is covered in
principle in ID 148 Scope of consolidation for non-EU and unconsolidated subsidiaries in relation

Question asked
Can undertakings report different metrics related to the same sustainability matter in different
parts of the value chain depending on the nature of the impact, for example water withdrawal for
own operations and water consumption for upstream value chain?
ESRS Reference
ESRS E3-4 paragraph 28 (a) and (b) and AR 32
Key terms
Value chain metrics; water metrics; water withdrawal; water consumption
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 63 states: ‘The information about the reporting undertaking provided in the
sustainability statement shall be extended to include information on the material impacts, risks
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 189 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
and opportunities connected with the undertaking through its direct and indirect business
relationships in the upstream and/or downstream value chain (“value chain information”). In
extending the information about the reporting undertaking, the undertaking shall include
material impacts, risks and opportunities connected with its upstream and downstream value
chain:
(a) following the outcome of its due diligence process and of its materiality assessment; and
(b) in accordance with any specific requirements related to the value chain in other ESRS.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 64 states: ‘Different sustainability matters can be material in relation to different
parts of the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 75 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose any metrics that it uses to evaluate
performance and effectiveness in relation to a material impact, risk or opportunity.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 76 states: ‘Metrics shall include those defined in ESRS, as well as metrics
identified on an entity-specific basis, whether taken from other sources or developed by the
undertaking itself.’
IG 2 Value chain, ‘Summary in 7 key points’, point 5 states: ‘Topical standards require to include
VC data only for a few metrics. However, when the undertaking considers that a material IRO in
the VC is not sufficiently covered by the requirements in ESRS, it shall include additional entity-
specific disclosures, including metrics when such information is necessary in order to enable users
to understand the undertaking’s material impacts, risks or opportunities.’
Answer
Yes, the undertaking can report different metrics for the same sustainability matter for different
parts of its value chain based on which metrics are deemed material for its own operations and
its value chain. In relation to the example provided by the submitter, this means that the
undertaking would disclose its water consumption in relation to its upstream value chain if
material (this would be an entity-specific disclosure when applying sector-agnostic standards), but
it would not disclose its water consumption in its own operations if not material. At the same
time, it could disclose water withdrawal for its own operations if material (this is an optional
metric) but not disclose this metric in relation to its upstream or downstream value chain if
impacts in the value chain are not material. If only impacts upstream are material, the metric in
relation to own operation and downstream value chain are not disclosed.
More specifically, concerning this example the following is to be noted. ESRS E3-4 paragraph 28(a)
requires reporting water consumption in the undertaking’s own operations only. If the
undertaking deems that this metric is not material for its own operations, it shall not disclose it
(see ESRS 1 paragraph 34 (b)). At the same time, if the metric water consumption is identified as
material in the upstream or downstream value chain, the undertaking would be required to
disclose it as an entity-specific metric (see ESRS 1 paragraph 11).
ESRS E3-4 paragraph AR 32 provides the option to disclose the metric on the undertaking’s water
withdrawal. Therefore, if the undertaking considers this metric material for its own operation, it
may choose to disclose it. At the same time, if this metric is deemed not material for its upstream
or downstream value chain, it would not disclose it in connection to the value chain.

Background
To better address the issue addressed by the submitter, it was agreed to change the question
received, ‘The level of detail required in measuring pollutants is very unclear; could you please
clarify?’ to the question above.
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to

requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 54 states: ‘When needed for a proper understanding of its material impacts, risks
and opportunities, the undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information … (b) by significant
site or by significant asset, when material impacts, risks and opportunities are highly dependent
on a specific location or asset.’ ESRS 1 paragraph 69 states: ‘There are circumstances where the
undertaking cannot collect the information about its upstream and downstream value chain as
required by paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts to do so. In these circumstances, the
undertaking shall estimate the information to be reported about its upstream and downstream
value chain by using all reasonable and supportable information, such as sector-average data and
other proxies’.
ESRS 1 paragraph 72 states: ‘The incorporation of estimates made using sector-average data or
other proxies shall not result in information that does not meet the qualitative characteristics of
information (see Chapter 2 and Section 7.2 Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty of this
Standard)’.
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 191 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS E2 paragraph 28) states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the amounts of: (a) each pollutant
listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register ‘E-PRTR Regulation’) emitted to air, water and
soil, with the exception of emissions of GHGs which are disclosed in accordance with ESRS E1
Climate Change; (b) microplastics generated or used by the undertaking.’
ESRS E2 paragraph 29 states: ‘The consolidation shall include only the emissions from facilities for
which the applicable threshold value specified in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 is
exceeded.’
ESRS E2-4 paragraph 31 states: ‘When an inferior methodology compared to direct measurement
of emissions is chosen to quantify emissions, the reasons for choosing this inferior methodology
shall be outlined by the undertaking. If the undertaking uses estimates, it shall disclose the
standard, sectoral study or sources which form the basis of its estimates, as well as the possible
degree of uncertainty and the range of estimates reflecting the measurement uncertainty.’
ESRS E2 paragraph AR 26 states: ‘When providing information on pollutants , the undertaking shall
consider approaches for quantification in the following order of priority: (a) direct measurement
of emissions, effluents or other pollution through the use of recognised continuous monitoring
systems (e.g., AMS Automated Measuring Systems); (b) periodic measurements; (c) calculation
based on site -specific data; (d) calculation based on published pollution factors; and (e)
estimation.’
ESRS E2 paragraph 11 states: ‘The undertaking shall describe the process to identify material
impacts, risks and opportunities and shall provide information on: (a) whether the undertaking
has screened its site locations and business activities in order to identify its actual and potential
pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities in its own operations and upstream and
downstream value chain, and if so, the methodologies, assumptions and tools used in the
screening; (b) whether and how the undertaking has conducted consultations, in particular with
affected communities.’
Regulation (EU) 2024/1244 (IEPR), Annex I, provides a list of activities that fall within its scope.
Recital (12) states: ‘To comply with the requirements of the Protocol, the reporting requirements
provided for in this Regulation should apply to all activities listed in Annex I to the Protocol and, in
fulfilling those reporting requirements, the facility to which the installation, or part thereof,
belongs should be indicated. In addition, and with a view to achieving synergies with related Union
environmental law affecting industrial installations, the scope of this Regulation should also be
aligned with the industrial activities under Annexes I and Ia to Directive 2010/75/EU and with
certain activities covered by Directive (EU) 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and of the
Council’.
Answer
(1) Could you clarify the level of detail required in reporting pollutants (including
microplastics)?
The level of detail required in reporting pollutants is not specific. The selection of pollutants that
the undertakings will need to disclose will depend on the pollutants (including microplastics) that
are material for their specific operations (ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement IRO-1). Therefore, the
undertaking will need to conduct a materiality assessment, including being transparent on
whether any screening of its site locations and business activities were conducted, considering
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 192 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
the pollutants they emit, the quantities, and the associated impacts of those emissions, as well as
any consultations with the communities that are affected by its operations where appropriate. In
addition, the undertaking shall disaggregate the information by significant site or by significant
asset when material pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities are highly dependent on a
specific location or asset. For further information on the disaggregation of reported pollutant
emissions, please consult ID 440.
(2) When is it possible to resort to estimations?
Estimations are generally considered a less preferable measuring methodology compared to
direct observations. However, should the undertaking be compelled to resort to reporting by
estimation (e.g. due to the unfeasibility of collecting information about its upstream and
downstream value chain), it should provide an explanation as well as a description of the
methodologies, assumptions and tools used. The incorporation of estimates made using sector-
average data or other proxies shall meet the qualitative characteristics of information as defined
in ESRS 1. In the specific case of microplastics, it is worth noting that estimations may be the only
feasible measuring methodology (particularly in the case of wear and tear of larger pieces of
plastics, such as car tires or synthetic textiles) and, therefore, undertakings will most likely resort
to estimations when reporting on microplastics.
(3) Do all the pollutants listed in the E-PRTR and all microplastics need to be measured?
In terms of E-PRTR pollutants, considering that the undertaking will need to refer to all material
pollutants, it will report only on each material pollutant listed in the E-PRTR under ESRS E2-4
paragraph 28(a), whereas other pollutants assessed as material but not included in the E-PRTR
are to be reported under entity-specific disclosures.

ESRS E4 paragraph AR 4 states: ‘The materiality assessment under ESRS E4 includes the
undertaking’s:
(a) contribution to direct impact drivers on biodiversity loss:
i. climate change;
ii. land-use change (e.g. land artificialisation), freshwater-use change and sea-use
change;
iii. direct exploitation;
iv. invasive alien species ;
v. pollution; and
vi. others.
…’
‘Impact Drivers’ is defined in the ESRS Glossary as: ‘All the factors that cause changes in nature,
anthropogenic assets, nature’s contributions to people and a good quality of life. Direct drivers
of change can be both natural and anthropogenic; they have direct physical (mechanical,
chemical, noise, light, etc.) and behaviour-affecting impacts on nature. They include, inter alia,
climate change, pollution, different types of land use change, invasive alien species and zoonoses,
and exploitation. Indirect impact drivers operate diffusely by altering and influencing direct
drivers (by affecting their level, direction or rate) as well as other indirect drivers. Interactions
between indirect and direct drivers create different chains of relationship, attribution, and
impacts, which may vary according to type, intensity, duration, and distance. These relationships
can also lead to different types of spill-over effects. Global indirect drivers include economic,
demographic, governance, technological and cultural ones. Special attention is given, among
indirect drivers, to the role of institutions (both formal and informal) and impacts of the patterns
of production, supply and consumption on nature, nature’s contributions to people and good
quality of life.’
The ESRS E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems Basis for Conclusions (March2023) states: ‘According to
the IPBES, pressures on biodiversity and ecosystems, also termed key biodiversity loss impact
drivers, originate from five categories of impact drivers: land-use or habitat change, climate
change, pollution, natural resource use and exploitation, as well as invasive species …’.
The term ‘Direct drivers (of biodiversity and ecosystem change)’ is a term first coined by the
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The
IPBES defines direct drivers: ‘Direct drivers (natural and anthropogenic) are drivers that
unequivocally influence biodiversity and ecosystem processes (also referred to as “pressures”).’
Find more information, also on the definition of ‘indirect drivers’, here:
https://www.ipbes.net/models-drivers-biodiversity-ecosystem-change.
Answer
The term ‘direct’ refers to the immediate or unambiguous pressure or impact that climate change,
land/fresh water/sea-use change, pollution, direct exploitation and invasive alien species have on
biodiversity and ecosystems’ loss or degradation. The term ‘direct’ in this context does not refer
to whether the impact originates from the undertaking’s own operations or from its upstream or
downstream value chain. Direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss can be connected to the
undertaking’s own operations, to its upstream or downstream value chain or to all of them. The
term ‘direct drivers’ was first introduced by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES; see background).

For example, consider an undertaking that uses timber as a primary material in one of its
products. The extraction of timber (a direct exploitation of a natural resource, which is one of the
five impact drivers) causes a negative impact on the natural habitat from which it is sourced,
leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Whether the extraction is carried out by
the undertaking itself (own operations) or, for instance, by one of its suppliers (upstream value
chain), this exploitation of natural resources would be a ‘direct driver’ of ecosystem and
biodiversity loss in that specific location.
In the context of the ESRS, ‘Direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss’ and ‘Direct drivers of
biodiversity and ecosystems change’ can be used interchangeably (see also the ESRS Glossary’s
definition of ‘Impact drivers’ in the background above).

ESRS E4-5 paragraph 35 states: ‘If the undertaking identified sites located in or near biodiversity-
sensitive areas that it is negatively affecting (see paragraph 19 (a)), the undertaking shall disclose
the number and area (in hectares) of sites owned, leased or managed in or near these protected

and based on its conclusions the necessary mitigation measures (4) are implemented.’
The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global database of
marine and terrestrial protected areas. It is a joint project between the UN Environment
Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and it is managed by
the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) in
collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry.
Answer
To identify a biodiversity-sensitive area that meets the criteria of ESRS E4 Disclosure Requirement
E4-5, it is sufficient that the area is listed in only one of the sources mentioned under the
definition of biodiversity-sensitive area in the ESRS Glossary of Terms (see background).
If the relevant site is not included under the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO
World Heritage sites and/or Key Biodiversity Areas (‘KBAs’), the undertaking needs to assess if it
falls under ‘other protected areas’ as per the ESRS glossary definition. Other protected areas
could be, for instance, forest protected areas or areas lying within river basin districts designated
as requiring special protection by governmental authorities. This may require consulting national
legislation sources defining these other protected areas. In addition, the World Database on
Protected Areas (WDPA) can support preparers in the identification of protected areas.

Key terms
Metrics; mandatory
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 11 states: ‘In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three
categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not
covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific
facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 197 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities . Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 34 states: ‘When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability
matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking:
(a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such
information to be material; and
(b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it
assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not
needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 3 states ‘When determining the usefulness of metrics for inclusion in its
entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall consider whether:
(a) its chosen performance metrics provide insight into:
i. how effective its practices are in reducing negative outcomes and/or increasing
positive outcomes for people and the environment (for impacts); and/or
ii. the likelihood that its practices result in financial effects on the undertaking (for risks
and opportunities);
(b) the measured outcomes are sufficiently reliable, meaning that they do not involve an
excessive number of assumptions and unknowns that would render the metrics too
arbitrary to provide a faithful representation; and
(c) it has provided sufficient contextual information to interpret performance metrics
appropriately, and whether variations in such contextual information may impact the
comparability of the metrics over time.’
ESRS E4 paragraph 33 states: ‘The undertaking shall report metrics related to its material impacts
on biodiversity and ecosystems.’
ESRS E4 paragraph 35 states: ‘If the undertaking identified sites located in or near biodiversity-
sensitive areas that it is negatively affecting (see paragraph 19(a)), the undertaking shall disclose
the number and area (in hectares) of sites owned, leased or managed in or near these protected
areas or key biodiversity areas.
ESRS E4 paragraph 38 states: ‘If the undertaking has concluded that it directly contributes to the
impact drivers of land-use change, freshwater-use change and/or sea-use change, it shall report
relevant metrics. The undertaking may disclose metrics that measure:
(a) the conversion over time (e.g. 1 or 5 years) of land cover (e.g. deforestation or mining);
(b) changes over time (e.g. 1 or 5 years) in the management of the ecosystem (e.g.
through the intensification of agricultural management, or the application of better
management practices or forestry harvesting);
(c) changes in the spatial configuration of the landscape (e.g. fragmentation of habitats,
changes in ecosystem connectivity);
(d) changes in ecosystem structural connectivity (e.g. habitat permeability based on
physical features and arrangements of habitat patches); and
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 198 of 278

(e) the functional connectivity (e.g. how well genes or individuals move through land,
freshwater and seascape).’
ESRS E4 paragraph 39 states: ‘If the undertaking concluded that it directly contributes to the
accidental or voluntary introduction of invasive alien species, the undertaking may disclose the
metrics it uses to manage pathways of introduction and spread of invasive alien species and the
risks posed by invasive alien species.’
ESRS E4 paragraph 40 states: ‘If the undertaking identified material imp
cts related to the state of species, the undertaking may report metrics it considers relevant. The
undertaking may:
(a) refer to relevant disclosure requirements in ESRS E1, ESRS E2, ESRS E3, and ESRS E5;
(b) consider population size, range within specific ecosystems as well as extinction risk.
These aspects provide insight on the health of a single species’ population and its
relative resilience to human induced and naturally occurring change;
(c) disclose metrics that measure changes in the number of individuals of a species within
a specific area;
(d) disclose metrics on species at extinction risk (80) that measure:
i. the threat status of species and how activities/pressures may affect the threat
status; or
ii. changes in the relevant habitat for a threatened species as a proxy for the
undertaking’s impact on the local population’s extinction risk.’
ESRS E4 paragraph 41 states: ‘If the undertaking identified material impacts related to ecosystems,
it may disclose:
(a) with regard to ecosystems extent, metrics that measure area coverage of a particular
ecosystem without necessarily considering the quality of the area being assessed, such
as habitat cover. For example, forest cover is a measure of the extent of a particular
ecosystem type, without factoring in the condition of the ecosystem (e.g. provides the
area without describing the species diversity w
(b) thin the forest);
(c) with regard to the ecosystem’s condition:
i. metrics that measure the quality of ecosystems relative to a pre-determined
reference state;
ii. metrics that measure multiple species within an ecosystem rather than the
number of individuals within a single species within an ecosystem (for example:
scientifically established species richness and abundance indicators that measure
the development of (native) species composition within an ecosystem against the
reference state at the beginning of the first reporting period as well as the
targeted state outlined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,
or an aggregation of species’ conservation status if relevant); or
iii. metrics that reflect structural components of condition such as habitat
connectivity (i.e. how linked habitats are to each other).’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 199 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Answer
No, ESRS E4 does not require reporting metrics for each material impact. For ESRS E4, it is only
mandatory for the undertaking to report metrics for ESRS E4 paragraph 35 (if the undertaking
identified sites located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas that it is negatively affecting) and
for paragraph 38. In applying paragraphs 35 and 38, the conditions of ESRS 1 paragraph 34 apply
(see background). The disclosure of metrics related to ESRS E4 paragraphs 39, 40 and 41 is
voluntary even if the undertaking has identified material impacts in connection with the subtopics
mentioned in those paragraphs (the undertaking would still be required to disclose on the other
provisions listed in ESRS E4 for those material subtopics).
With regard to ESRS E4 paragraph 38, the undertaking can choose to disclose metrics that
measure other or only a few of the aspects listed in that paragraph. The undertaking shall refer
to ESRS 1 paragraph 11 when identifying relevant entity-specific metrics.
Impact metrics in ESRS E4 are rarely standardized. For disclosure requirements where they are
not, it is the responsibility of the undertaking to identify the metrics that are relevant to be
disclosed (see ESRS 1 paragraph 31 and Appendix B of ESRS 1 for the definition of ‘relevance’). To
assist the undertakings in this process, ESRS E4-5 indicates metrics or indicators that measure
relevant aspects related to ecosystems and biodiversity and that may be material for
undertakings to disclose.
In relation to paragraphs 39, 40 and 41, reporting on metrics is optional. However, if the
undertaking concludes that the inclusion of entity specific metric(s) is necessary (ESRS 1
paragraph 11), the provisions in these paragraphs support the identification of relevant metrics
to be reported.

Description of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities, as listed
in ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable

Answer
No, if the undertaking concludes that it is not negatively affecting biodiversity-sensitive areas in
or near sites that it owns, leases or manages, it shall not disclose the number and area of those
sites (in relation to ESRS E4 paragraph 35).
The undertaking, however, must always disclose whether it has sites located in or near
biodiversity-sensitive areas and whether activities related to these sites negatively affect these
areas under ESRS E4 paragraph 19 (a). This disclosure is related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 and, therefore,
this information needs to be disclosed irrespective of the outcome of the undertaking’s
materiality assessment considering relevance of information (see ESRS 1 paragraphs 29 and 31).

Key terms
Biodiversity-sensitive areas; area of site
Background
ESRS E4 paragraph 35 states: ‘If the undertaking identified sites located in or near biodiversity-
sensitive areas that it is negatively affecting (see paragraph 19(a)), the undertaking shall disclose
the number and area (in hectares) of sites owned, leased or managed in or near these protected
areas or key biodiversity areas.’
ESRS E4 paragraph 19(a) states: ‘The undertaking shall specifically disclose: (a) whether or not it
has sites located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas and whether activities related to these
sites negatively affect these areas by leading to the deterioration of natural habitats and the
habitats of species and to the disturbance of the species for which a protected area has been
designated …’.
Answer
The undertaking is required to disclose the total area (in hectares) of a site owned, leased or
managed in or near protected areas or key biodiversity areas if it has activities related to these
sites that are negatively affecting a biodiversity-sensitive area. The disclosure refers to the total
area of the site, not just the portion that may fall within or be adjacent to the biodiversity-
sensitive area.
Information on the total size of a site can be relevant to assess the undertaking’s actual and
potential impacts, as activities carried out in the site beyond the immediately adjacent or
overlapping portions of a site can still affect biodiversity-sensitive areas nearby.
What to consider as ‘near’ depends on the type of impact that the company has on the
biodiversity-sensitive area. It could, for example, depend on the type and amount of pollutant
emitted by the undertaking and whether it is transported by water flows (e.g. rivers), ground
water or air currents, potentially impacting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems kilometres away
from the pollution source.
If the impact is directly related to land-use or land-use change, an understanding of the portion
of the site overlapping or adjacent to the biodiversity-sensitive area will better inform the
assessment of the impact of the undertaking on the biodiversity-sensitive site.
However, if the impacts are related to the integrity/fragmentation of habitats or the structural
connectivity of ecosystems that affect the movement of species between different areas, then
land-use or land-use change may be relevant to characterise even if not adjacent or overlapping
with the biodiversity-sensitive area. For example, the enlargement of a production site or land-
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 202 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
use change for agriculture between two biodiversity-sensitive areas may affect the connectivity
between the populations of a species and have a significant effect on their overall viability on both
biodiversity-sensitive areas. In this case, the undertaking’s site is not overlapping with or adjacent
to any biodiversity-sensitive area, but the undertaking will define as ‘near’ the two biodiversity-
sensitive sites based on its assessment of its actual or potential material impacts.
Characteristics like magnitude (e.g. amount of contaminant, noise intensity), spatial extent (e.g.
area of land contaminated, area of land converted to agriculture, size of habitat fragmentation)
and temporal extent (e.g. duration of persistence of contaminant, duration of habitat
modification) determine how impacts affect ecosystems and biodiversity and at what distance
and therefore help identify whether the undertaking’s site is located ‘near’ a biodiversity-sensitive
area.

(a) the total amount of waste generated;
(b) the total amount by weight diverted from disposal, with a breakdown between
hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste and a breakdown by the following
recovery operation types:
i. preparation for reuse;
ii. recycling; and
iii. other energy recovery;
(c) the amount by weight directed to disposal by waste treatment type and the total

(d) the total amount and percentage of non-recycled waste.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 204 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Waste is defined in Annex II Glossary of Acronyms and Terms as ‘Any substance or object which
the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.’ This definition refers to Article 3(1) of
Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on
waste and repealing certain Directives (Waste Framework Directive or WFD).
Incineration is defined in Annex II Glossary of Acronyms and Terms as ‘The controlled burning of
waste at high temperature with or without energy recovery.’
Recovery is defined in Annex II Glossary of Acronyms and Terms as ‘Any operation the principal
result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by replacing other materials which would
otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfil that
function, in the plant or in the wider economy.’ This definition refers to article 3(15) of the WFD.
Likewise, Article 3(15a) of the WFD on the definition of material recovery states that ‘“material
recovery” means any recovery operation, other than energy recovery and the reprocessing into
materials that are to be used as fuels or other means to generate energy’.
In addition, ESRS E5 Disclosure Requirement 5-1 requires an undertaking to consider whether and
how its policies address the waste hierarchy (as per Article 4(1) of the WFD: (a) prevention; (b)
preparing for re-use; (c) recycling; (d) other recovery, e.g. energy recovery; and (e) disposal.
The WFD also provides a list of Disposal and Recovery Operations in its Annex I and Annex II,
respectively. While incineration is included in Annex I of disposal operations (‘D10 Incineration on
land’), Annex II on recovery includes operation ‘R1 Use principally as fuel or other means to
generate energy’. This category potentially includes co-incineration where wastes are burned for
their fuel content, and a note is also included allowing the inclusion of Municipal Solid Waste
(MSW) incineration provided that a certain level of energy efficiency is achieved.
Answer
Incineration is to be treated as a recovery operation if it meets the conditions to be considered as
an ‘R1 Use principally as fuel or other means to generate energy’ operation, according to Annex
II of the Waste Framework Directive. In this case, it is considered as an ‘other energy recovery’
under ESRS E5 paragraph 37(b)(iii).
If the conditions in which incineration occurs are conducive to its classification as a ‘D10
incineration on land’ operation (Annex II of the Waste Framework Directive), then it shall be
classified as a disposal operation.

Recycled waste
Background
ESRS E5-5 paragraph 37 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose the following information on its
total amount of waste from its own operations, in tonnes or kilogrammes:
(a) the total amount of waste generated;
(b) the total amount by weight diverted from disposal, with a breakdown between
hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste and a breakdown by the following recovery
operation types:
(i) preparation for reuse;
(ii) recycling; and
(iii) other recovery operations …
(d) the total amount and percentage of non-recycled waste.’
Directive 2008/98/EC (Waste Framework Directive (WFD)), Article 4, includes recycling as part of
a waste hierarchy for waste management: ‘The following waste hierarchy shall apply as a priority
order in waste prevention and management legislation and policy: (a) prevention; (b) preparing
for re-use; (c) recycling; (d) other recovery, e.g. energy recovery; and (e) disposal’.
Answer
Yes, undertakings can assume that recycled waste can be calculated by subtracting non-recycled
waste from total waste provided that they consider all proper components in the equation of the
total waste (in order to understand what can be considered as ‘non-recycled waste’) and provided
that they know all components except the one of recycled waste.
As per the Waste Framework Directive (WFD), these are the components that need to be
considered in the equation of the total waste generated:
Total waste = recycled waste + reused waste + other recovery + disposed waste.
The above categories are to be understood as per definitions in the WFD:
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 206 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(a) Recycled waste: any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into
products, materials or substances. This includes the reprocessing of organic material but
excludes energy recovery and reprocessing into materials used as fuels.
(b) Reused waste: involves checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations by which
products or components of products that have become waste are prepared to be re-used
without other pre-processing.
(c) Other recovery: any waste-recovery operation that serves a useful purpose by replacing
other materials. Notably, it includes energy recovery (e.g. incineration with energy
recovery).
(d) Disposed waste: waste that is not recovered (recycled or otherwise diverted from
disposal) and is sent to landfill or other disposal methods.
Nevertheless, given the equation, a missing component can be derived if the other components
in the equation are known. To calculate recycled waste, if this component is not known and all
others are, undertakings would have to use the following equation:
Recycled waste = total waste – (reused waste + other recovery + disposed waste)

ESRS E5 paragraph 37 (b) and (c) require a breakdown by certain waste management operations,
namely:
(a) waste not directed to disposal operations by recovery operation type (E5 paragraph
37(b)(i)-(iii), which connects to the list of recovery operations in Annex II of the Waste
Directive; and
(b) waste directed to disposal operations by waste treatment types (E5 paragraphs 37(c)(i)-
(iii), which connect to the list of disposal operations in Annex I of the Waste Directive.
The ESRS Glossary’s definition of ‘incineration’ reads as follows: ‘Incineration is the controlled
burning of waste at high temperature with or without energy recovery.’
Answer
Composting and fermentation of organic wastes are considered a form of recycling – see Directive
2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (Waste Framework Directive, WFD),
Annex II, ‘R3 Recycling/reclamation of organic substances which are not used as solvents
(including composting and other biological transformation processes)’ – and a recovery operation
for the purposes of ESRS 5 paragraph 37 (b) (ii).
According to Annex l of the WFD, incineration without energy recovery is considered a disposal
operation (included as ‘D10 Incineration on land’) and is classified under ESRS E5 paragraph
37 (c) (i) Annex ll of the WFD, which sets out the different types of recovery operations.
Incineration with energy recovery is considered disposal if the criteria is not met (as explained in
the footnote to R1 of Annex ll, of the WFD) and is to be classified under the ‘R1 Use principally as
a fuel or other means to generate energy’ operation. If classified as an ‘R1 Use principally as a fuel
or other means to generate energy’ operation, incineration with energy recovery can be
considered under ESRS E5 paragraph 38(b)(iii) as ‘other recovery operations’.

Workforce” includes people who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking
(“employees”) and non-employees who are either individual contractors supplying labour to the
undertaking (“self-employed people”) or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in
employment activities (NACE Code N78).’
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 62 provides the following examples: ‘Examples of contractors (self-
employed people) in the undertaking’s own workforce include: contractors hired by the
undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee; contractors
hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (for example, on a road, on the street);
and contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of
a client of the organization. Examples of people employed by a third party engaged in
“employment activities” whose work is under the direction of the undertaking include: people
who perform the same work that employees carry out, such as people who fill in for employees

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.); people performing
regular work at the same site as employees; and workers who are dispatched temporarily from
another EU Member State to work for the undertaking (“posted workers”). Examples of value
chain workers (and thus of workers not in the undertaking’s own workforce and reported under
the scope of ESRS S2) include: workers for a supplier contracted by the undertaking who work on
the supplier’s premises using the supplier’s work methods; workers for a “downstream” entity
which purchases goods or services from the undertaking; and workers of an equipment supplier
to the undertaking who, at one or more of the undertaking’s workplaces, perform regular
maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (for example, photocopier) as stipulated in the contract
between the equipment supplier and the undertaking.’
Answer
The ESRS definition is not based on the type of activities performed by employees (i.e. ‘core’ or
‘non-core’) and as such this terminology is not used in the ESRS. The definition is based on the
type of contract or labour relation. Non-employees include two types of workers, self-employed
workers and persons provided by undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’ for
whom the undertaking should have direct access to data on these types of workers (ESRS S1
paragraph 119; see also Question ID 33 Definitions of non-employees). Value chain workers
include all workers who are not in the scope of ‘Own Workforce’ and do not have a contractual
relationship with the undertaking. Examples of workers in the value chain may be found in ESRS
S2 paragraph AR 3, which include, for example, ‘workers of a supplier contracted by the
undertaking.’ ESRS S1 paragraph AR 62 also provides examples of both non-employees and value
chain workers.

Resources to manage material impacts
Background
The original question received has been reworded to the above to be clearer. The original question
was: ‘When mentioning ‘material impacts’ in paragraph 43 of ESRS S1-4, it is unclear if you mean
‘all’ material impacts or ‘own workforce’ material impacts.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 1 clarifies the objective of ESRS S1, specifying that Disclosure Requirements in
this topical standard will ‘enable users of the sustainability statement to understand the
undertaking’s material impacts on its own workforce.’
ESRS S1-4 paragraph 43 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose what resources are allocated to the
management of its material impacts, with information that allows users to gain an understanding
of how the material impacts are managed.’
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 48 further explains: ‘When disclosing the resources allocated to the
management of material impacts, the undertaking may explain which internal functions are
involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative, and
advance positive, impacts.’
Answer
‘Resources allocated to the management of material impacts’ refers only to the disclosure of
resources allocated to the management of material matters pertaining to the ‘own workforce’
topic.
As paragraph 43 of ESRS S1-4 is part of the topical standard on ‘own workforce’, ‘material impacts’
in that paragraph is intended to refer specifically to material impacts on own workforce.

Question ID 31 - Breakdown of temporary, permanent, and non-
guaranteed hours employees
Release date
March 2024
Question asked
Is this a three-way split or are non-guaranteed hours employees part of temporary/permanent
employees?
ESRS reference
ESRS S1 paragraphs 50 (b), AR 55, and AR56
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 211 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key Terms
Employees permanent; employees temporary; employees non-guaranteed hours
Background
ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (b) requires the disclosure of: ‘(b) the total number by head count or full-
time equivalent (FTE) of:
(i) permanent employees, and breakdown by gender;
(ii) temporary employees, and breakdown by gender; and
(iii) non-guaranteed hours employees, and breakdown by gender.’
Further information on how to present this information can be found in Table 3 and Table 4 in
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 55, while ESRS S1 paragraph AR 56 also provides a definition of non-
guaranteed hours employees as following: ‘Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by
the undertaking without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The
employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is
not contractually obliged to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per
day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call
employees are examples that fall under this category.’
Answer
ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (b) requires a three-way split of employees as the text distinguishes
between three datapoints, (i) permanent, (ii) temporary and (iii) non-guaranteed hours
employees, and it specifies that a breakdown by gender is required for the three datapoints. In
addition, ESRS S1 paragraph AR 55, Table 3 and Table 4 offer further guidance by providing the
template for presenting information on employees by contract type.
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 56 specifies that ‘the definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed
hours . . . employees differ between countries . . .’ and it also provides a definition of non-
guaranteed hours employees. While permanent and temporary employment relationships define
the duration of a contract, a non-guaranteed hours contract refers mainly to the expected working
time. The defining characteristic of non-guaranteed hours contracts is that they do not guarantee
a minimum or fixed number of working hours.
In some countries, non-guaranteed hours contracts may be further classified as either permanent
or temporary according to national legislation. Hence, in these countries the undertaking reports
those non-guaranteed hours employees under paragraph 50 (b)(iii) and also under paragraph 50
(b)(i) or (ii). The provision of contextual information in ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (e) requires
explaining how the information is reported; for example, the undertaking would describe if non-
guaranteed hours employees are also included within the permanent and temporary datapoints.

(2) Can FTE be used as a proxy for head counts if 99% of the workforce is full-time?

Key terms
Methodology to compile data; FTE
Background
The question received: ‘Is there a materiality approach for the people reporting in place (for
example, if 99% of the workforce are full-time employees, the difference between our existing
FTE reporting and head count is negligible)? Does an additional head count reporting have to be
set up or can we keep FTE reporting and provide background information to users?’ has been
reworded to the above question to be clearer.
ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-6 on the characteristics of the undertaking’s employees
requires information on the number of employees and the number of breakdowns. The objective
of S1-6 is for the undertaking to provide insight into its approach to employment, to provide
contextual information that facilitates an understanding of the information reported in other
disclosures and to serve as the basis for calculating quantitative metrics to be disclosed under
other disclosure requirements in this Standard.
ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (a) requires the disclosure of ‘the total number of employees by head count,
and breakdowns by gender and by country for countries in which the undertaking has 50 or more
employees representing at least 10% of its total number of employees’. This requirement on the
number of employees is consistent with ESRS 2 SBM-1 paragraph 40 (a)(iii) whereby head count
data is also required.
ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-6 (paragraph 50 (b)) allows the undertaking to choose
between two methodologies to calculate the number of employees, which are either by head
count or full-time equivalent (FTE) of:
‘(i) permanent employees and breakdown by gender;
(ii) temporary employees and breakdown by gender; and
(iii) non-guaranteed hours employees and breakdown by gender.’
The voluntary disclosures in ESRS S1 paragraph 52 (a) (b) follow the same approach as detailed
above whereby there is the option of disclosing information on full-time and part-time employees
by either head count or FTE.
ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (d) requires ‘a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to
compile the data, including whether the numbers are reported:
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 213 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(i) in head count or full-time equivalent (FTE) (including an explanation of how FTE is
defined) …’.
Furthermore, ESRS S1 paragraph AR 55, Table 3 and Table 4 provide the relevant tables to present
this information in (Table 3: ‘Template for presenting information on employees by contract type,
broken down by gender (head count or FTE)’; and Table 4: ‘Template for presenting information
on employees by contract type, broken down by region (head count or FTE)’).
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 60 states: ‘Where data is not available for detailed information, the
undertaking shall use an estimation of the employee number or ratios, in accordance with ESRS
1, and clearly identify where the use of estimates has taken place.’
Answer
1. Are both FTE and head count figures to be reported?
The datapoint on the total number of employees (ESRS 1 paragraph 50 (a)) shall be reported in
terms of head count, since head count is the relevant metric for labour law and social policy (as
head count triggers many rights in social and labour law), and this is also consistent with the
requirements in ESRS 2 SBM-1 paragraph 40 (a)(iii).
Recognizing that it is common in some countries to report detailed employee information in full-
time equivalent (FTE) terms, S1-6 allows undertakings the option to report other datapoints
(permanent, temporary and non-guaranteed hours contract types as well as full- and part-time
contract types) in either head count or full-time equivalent (FTE) terms.
According to ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (b) and paragraph 52 (a)(b), the undertaking has two options
to report information on employees by contract type: head count or full-time equivalent. (ESRS
S1 paragraph AR 55, tables 3 and 4 contain the templates that undertakings shall use to disclose
this information.)
The option to report employee numbers with either head count or FTE metrics is explicitly allowed
only in S1-6 and in S1-7 when reporting on non-employees within own workforce. For the other
metrics in ESRS S1 (i.e., from ESRS S1-8 to ESRS S1-17), the disclosure requirements and their
related application requirements define the methodology to be followed for calculating
quantitative information on employees (for example, ESRS S1-14 AR80 on health and safety).
2. Can FTE be used as a proxy for head counts if 99% of the workforce is full-time?
For ESRS S1 paragraph 50 (a), there is no option with respect to the unit of account. The
undertaking is expected to comply with the text of ESRS by providing a figure according to the
unit of account as defined in the Disclosure Requirement. Still, an undertaking may refer to ESRS
S1 paragraph AR60 on the use of estimates and ratios.

Significant employment
Background
ESRS S1-6 paragraph 50 (a) requires the disclosure of the following information: ‘the total number
of employees by head count, and breakdowns by gender and by country for countries in which
the undertaking has 50 or more employees representing at least 10% of its total number of
employees.’ ESRS S1 paragraph AR54 explains that the ‘number of employees in each country is
also a key trigger for many information, consultation and participation rights for workers and
workers’ representatives, both in the Union labour acquis and in national law.’ This concept of
significant employment is furthermore clarified in Disclosure Requirement S1-8. ESRS S1
paragraph 60 (b) defines significant employment as ‘at least 50 employees by head count
representing at least 10% of its total number of employees.’
Answer
The breakdown by country must be disclosed for countries where at least 10% of the
undertaking’s employees are employed and the number of employees is at least 50, i.e. both
threshold conditions need to be met.
ESRS 1 paragraph 50 (a) requires different types of employee information:
(a) the total number of employees by head count; and
(b) breakdowns by gender and by country for countries in which the undertaking has 50 or
more employees representing at least 10% of its total number of employees.
As illustrated by Table 1 in ESRS S1 paragraph AR 55, the gender breakdown applies to all
employees, i.e., the minimum employment threshold at the country level for reporting does not
apply to this. As illustrated in Table 2 in ESRS S1 paragraph AR 55, the number of employees at the
country level is to be reported; however, this reporting is mandatory only for countries in which
both threshold conditions apply.

Many datapoints in the S1 have to be broken down by gender. Which definition of ‘gender’ is used
in the ESRS? Is it only the female-male categories or should answers contain a third, ‘diverse’
category or more categories when breaking down information by gender?
ESRS Reference
ESRS S1 paragraph 50(a), ESRS S1 paragraph AR55
Key terms
Sex, breakdown; male; female
Background
ESRS S1 paragraph 50(a) requires a disclosure of ‘the total number of employees by head count,
and breakdowns by gender ….’ ESRS S1 paragraph AR 55 provides a template for presenting
information on employee head count by gender (Table 1) and explains: ‘In some Member States
it is possible for persons to legally register themselves as having a third, often neutral, gender,
which is categorised as “other” in the table above. However, if the undertaking is disclosing data
about employees where this is not possible, it may explain this and indicate that the “other”
category is not applicable.’
Answer
ESRS do not define gender, but they acknowledge the legal existence of three categories: female,
male and other. The disclosure templates in ESRS S1 AR 55 correspond to Disclosure Requirement
S1-6, therefore containing these three categories as well as a provision for reporting about
countries that do not legally recognise a third gender category. Unless otherwise stated, and
provided that the reporting undertaking reports these three categories already under Disclosure
Requirement S1-6, these categories must be used when Disclosure Requirements in ESRS S1
require, or give the option of, the disaggregation of a quantitative indicator by gender.

Background
ESRS S1 paragraph 4 describes the scope of ESRS S1 and states: ‘this Standard covers an
undertaking’s own workforce, which is understood to include both people who are in an
employment relationship with the undertaking (“employees”) and non-employees who are either
people with contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self-employed people”) or people
provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78). See
Application Requirement 3 for examples of who falls under own workforce. The information
required to be disclosed with regard to non-employees shall not affect their status pursuant to
applicable labour law.’
In addition, ESRS S1 paragraph AR3 gives a number of examples of people who fall within the
category of non-employees and are included within ‘own workforce’; these are (a) contractors
(self-employed persons) and ‘(b) people employed by a third party engaged in “employment
activities” which include people who perform the same work that employees carry out.’
Answer
Since there is no definition of ‘employee’ provided under EU law, the status as an employee is
determined at the national level according to national laws and practice (employees are
individuals who are ‘in an employment relationship with the undertaking according to national
law and practice’).
The national labour law or practice of each country defines what type of contracts constitute an
employment relationship (i.e., an employee) and those that relate to non-employees.

to social dialogue: (a) the global percentage of employees covered by workers’ representatives,
reported at the country level for each EEA country in which the undertaking has significant
employment . . .’
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 69 specifies that, ‘for calculating the information required by paragraph 63
(a), the undertaking shall identify in which EEA countries it has significant employment (i.e., at
least 50 employees representing at least 10% of its total employees). For these countries it shall
report the percentage of employees in that country which are employed in establishments in
which employees are represented by workers’ representatives.’
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 70 provides a template for reporting on collective bargaining coverage and
social dialogue, specifying that it applies to ‘EEA countries only.’
Answer
The term ‘global’ refers to the total or overall percentage of employees in a specific EEA country
working in establishments (e.g., factories, branches) with workplace representation, based on the
International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) definition of workers’ representatives. Workplace
representation enables social dialogue at the establishment level, which is different from social
dialogue at the group, sectoral, national or EU level. As an undertaking may have several
establishments in one country, the aim of this metric is to obtain the overall percentage of
employees with workplace representation for each EEA country where the undertaking has
significant employment (i.e., at least 50 employees representing at least 10% of its total
employees).
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 70 provides a template to present this information in. The column under
the heading ‘Social dialogue’ provides an example of how an undertaking with significant
employment in two EEA countries (country A and country B) can report this data point.

employees do not have social protection with regard to one or more of the types of events listed
in paragraph 72 and for each of those countries the types of employees who do not have social
protection with regard to each applicable major life event.’
Answer
No, estimates or secondary data may not be used to determine whether an undertaking’s
employees are covered by social protection for this non-quantitative datapoint. Whether
employees are covered by social protection depends on public programs or benefits offered by
the undertaking (ESRS S1 paragraph 74). This information arises from the legal frameworks of the
various countries as well as contractual benefits provided by the undertaking to its employees.
Therefore, this information does not relate to quantitative metrics or value chain data, for which
the use of estimates may be appropriate (refer to ESRS 1 Chapter 5.2 and Chapter 7.2). However,
this does not rule out that some interpretation by the reporting undertaking may be needed when
compiling the information, for example, when laws about health insurance in a country in which
the undertaking operates are not perfectly clear about the kinds of illness that are covered.

Answer
Yes, the requirements of ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-11 are only fulfilled if both female
and male employees are covered by social protection provisions for parental leave programs
(either public or offered by the undertaking) on the grounds of birth or adoption of a child. By
definition, parental leave is granted to parents on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child
to take care of that child (who is considered to be a parent depends on national law). For more
information on family-related leave, including parental leave, see ESRS S1 Disclosure

Answer
The datapoints mentioned by the submitter relate to the SFDR principal adverse impacts.4
In some countries (especially outside the EEA), there may be restrictions on data collection of
employees. ESRS S1 acknowledges such restrictions for two specific datapoints but not as a
general principle; in particular, such provision is in ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-12, on
persons with disabilities as well as ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-14 (d)) on work-related ill

ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
Work-related injuries, rate of recordable work-related accidents
Background
ESRS S1 paragraph 86 states: ‘the undertaking shall disclose … the number of incidents associated
with work-related injuries, ill health and fatalities of its own workforce. In addition, it shall disclose
the number of fatalities as a result of work-related injuries and work-related ill health of other
workers working on the undertaking’s sites.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 88 states: ‘The disclosure required by paragraph 86 shall include the following
information, where applicable, broken down between employees and non-employees in the
undertaking’s own workforce: … (b) the number of fatalities as a result of work-related injuries
and work-related ill health; (c) the number and rate of recordable work-related accidents … (d) …
the number of cases of recordable work-related ill health … (e) … the number of days lost to work-
related injuries and fatalities from work-related accidents, work-related ill health and fatalities
from ill health.’
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 89 states: ‘In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking
shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its
own workforce and multiplied by 1 000 000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of
respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1 000 000 hours worked indicates
the number of work-related injuries per 500 full time people in the workforce over a 1-year
timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1 000 000 hours worked shall be used also
for undertakings with less than 500 people in the workforce.‘
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 91 states: ‘An undertaking shall include fatalities as a result of work-related
injuries in the calculation of the number and rate of recordable work-related injuries.’
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘recordable work-related injury or ill health’ as
a ‘work-related injury or ill health that results in any of the following: death, days away from work,
restricted work or transfer to another job, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of
consciousness; or significant injury or ill health diagnosed by a physician or other licensed
healthcare professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work
or job transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness.’
Answer
A work-related injury is one of the possible consequences of a work-related accident. This is
explained in the definition of ‘work-related incident’ provided in Annex II Acronyms and Glossary
of Terms: ‘Occurrence arising out of or in the course of work that could or does result in injury or
ill health … An incident that results in injury or ill health is often referred to as an “accident”. An
incident that has the potential to result in injury or ill health but where none occurs is often
referred to as a “close call”, “near-miss”, or “near-hit”.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 88 (c) requires a disclosure of the number and rate of recordable work-related
accidents, which includes accidents that result in work-related injuries and accidents that result
in work-related ill health. ESRS S1 paragraph AR 89 provides guidance on how to calculate the
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 224 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
rate of work-related injuries based on the number of cases of work-related injuries. ESRS S1
paragraph AR 91 specifies that fatalities as a result of work-related injuries should also be included
in the disclosure of ESRS S1 paragraph 88 (c).
To sum up, work-related incidents that result in work-related injury or ill health are work-related
accidents. Work-related accidents therefore include cases of both work-related injuries, including
work-related injuries that result in fatalities and cases of work-related ill health. To note, only the
cases of work-related ill health that occur as a result of accidents need to be considered. The
absolute number of recordable work-related accidents required by ESRS S1 paragraph 88(c) must
therefore include cases of both work-related injuries and work-related ill health.

Question asked
With regard to the undertaking’s employees, the number of days lost to work-related injuries and
fatalities from work-related accidents, work-related ill health and fatalities from ill health’: Why is
‘work-related’ not mentioned in the last part of the data point (fatalities from ill health) but is
attached to every other breakdown of this data point?
ESRS reference
ESRS S1 paragraphs 86 and 88 (e)
Key terms
Days lost; work-related; fatalities
Background
ESRS S1 paragraph 86 condenses the idea that: ‘The undertaking shall disclose information on …
the number of incidents associated with work-related injuries, ill health and fatalities of its own
workforce.’
ESRS S1 paragraph 88 states: ‘The disclosure required by paragraph 86 shall include the following
information, where applicable broken down between employees and non-employees in the
undertaking’s own workforce: …
(e) with regard to the undertaking’s employees, the number of days lost to work-related
injuries and fatalities from work-related accidents, work-related ill health and fatalities
from ill health.’
The definition for recordable work-related injury or ill health as provided in Annex II Acronyms
and Glossary of Terms also does not repeatedly refer to ‘work-related’ ill health: ‘work-related
injury or ill health that results in any of the following: i. death, days away from work, restricted
work or transfer to another job, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness; or
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 225 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ii. significant injury or ill health diagnosed by a physician or other licensed healthcare professional,
even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical
treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness.’
Answer
The objective of this Disclosure Requirement defines the information to be disclosed under ESRS
S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-14 and it describes fatalities to be disclosed that are the result of
work-related injuries and work-related ill health. Hence, ESRS S1 paragraph 88 (e) refers to work-
related ill health.

Question ID 340 – Entitlement to family-related leave
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
Does the metric ‘family-related leave’ presume that an employee is entitled to every concept of
family-related leave?
ESRS reference
ESRS S1-15 paragraphs 93, AR96, and AR97
Key terms
Work-life balance; entitlement to take family-related leave
Background
Family-related leave is addressed in ESRS S1 Disclosure Requirement S1-15; specifically, ESRS S1
paragraph 93 requires a disclosure of ‘(a) the percentage of employees entitled to take family-
related leave ...’
The relevant definitions can be found in ESRS S1 paragraph AR 96, explaining that ‘family-related
leave includes maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave and carer’s leave that is available
under national law or collective agreements. For the purposes of this Standard, these concepts
are defined as:
(a) maternity leave (also called pregnancy leave): employment-protected leave of absence for
employed women directly around the time of childbirth (or, in some countries, adoption);
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 226 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
(b) paternity leave: leave from work for fathers or, where and insofar as recognised by national
law, for equivalent second parents, on the occasion of the birth or adoption of a child for the
purposes of providing care;
(c) parental leave: leave from work for parents on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child
to take care of that child, as defined by each Member State;
(d) carer’s leave from work: leave for workers to provide personal care or support to a relative,
or a person who lives in the same household, in need of significant care or support for a
serious medical reason, as defined by each Member State.’
Furthermore, ESRS S1 paragraph AR 97 clarifies: ‘... employees entitled to family-related leave are
those who are covered by regulations, organisational policies, agreements, contracts or collective
bargaining agreements that contain family-related leave entitlements and have reported their
entitlement to the undertaking or the undertaking is aware of the entitlement.’
Answer
Yes, family-related leave is defined as including maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave
and carer’s leave (ESRS S1 paragraph AR 96). The focus of the Disclosure Requirement is family-
related leave covered by regulations (for example, government’s social protection), organisational
policies, agreements, contracts or collective agreements (ESRS S1 paragraph AR97) that contain
family-related leave entitlements. Such entitlements may differ at a country level.
Being entitled to take family-related leave would thus mean, based on national law or collective
agreements, for female employees to be entitled to take maternity, parental and carer’s leave and
for male employees to be entitled to paternity, parental and carer’s leave. The scope of family
leave may vary across countries, and such contextual information may be relevant to users (for
example, that employees are entitled to maternity leave but not to paternity leave in a given
country). If based on national law or collective agreements female/male employees are not
entitled to all the respective female/male types of family-related leave, then they would not
qualify to be considered in the nominator of the metric.

What conditions must be met to consider an employee as being entitled to maternity or paternity
or parental leave in the meaning of ESRS S1?
ESRS reference

Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 227 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Key terms
Work-life balance; family-related leave
Background
The objective of Disclosure Requirement S1-15 is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to: ‘provide an
understanding of the entitlement and actual practices amongst the employees to take family-
related leave.’ (ESRS S1 paragraph 92). ESRS S1 paragraph 93 (a) requires a disclosure of ‘(a) the
percentage of employees entitled to take family-related leave.’ ESRS S1 paragraph 94 adds: ‘If all
of the undertaking’s employees are entitled to family-related leave through social policy and/or
collective bargaining agreements, it is sufficient to disclose this in order to meet the requirements
of paragraph 93 (a).’
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 97 explains where the entitlement to family-related leave may derive from:
‘. . . employees entitled to family-related leave are those who are covered by regulations,
organisational policies, agreements, contracts or collective bargaining agreements that contain
family-related leave entitlements and have reported their entitlement to the undertaking or the
undertaking is aware of the entitlement.’
The relevant definitions, in line with EU legislation on work-life balance, can be found in ESRS S1
paragraph AR 96, explaining: ‘Family-related leave include maternity leave, paternity leave,
parental leave, and carers’ leave that is available under national law or collective agreements. For
the purposes of this Standard, these concepts are defined as:
(a) Maternity Leave (also called pregnancy leave): ‘employment-protected leave of absence
for employed women directly around the time of childbirth (or, in some countries,
adoption);
(b) Paternity Leave: leave from work for fathers or, where and in so far as recognised by
national law, for equivalent second parents, on the occasion of the birth or adoption of a
child for the purposes of providing care;
(c) Parental Leave: leave from work for parents on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a
child to take care of that child, as defined by each Member State;
(d) Carers’ Leave from work: leave for workers to provide personal care or support to a
relative, or a person who lives in the same household, in need of significant care or
support for a serious medical reason, as defined by each Member State.’
Answer
The entitlement to family-related leave does not depend on any triggering conditions (i.e., as
otherwise only pregnant employees would be entitled). Whether an employee is entitled to
family-related leave depends on family-related leave provisions under national law or collective
agreements (ESRS S1 paragraph AR96) where specific thresholds of minimum employment time
periods may exist to become entitled.
Employees entitled to family-related leave are those who are covered by regulations,
organisational policies, agreements, contracts or collective bargaining agreements that contain
family-related leave entitlements. The scope of family leave entitlement may vary across
countries, and such contextual information may be relevant to disclose to users.

Question ID 132 - Gender pay gap
Release date
March 2024
Question asked
Can you please specify if for the below indicators: the gender pay gap, defined as the difference
of average pay levels between female and male employees, expressed as percentage of the
average pay level of male employees; should we include variable components of salary or only
gross wage?
ESRS reference
ESRS S1-16 paragraphs 95, 97, and 98
Key Terms
Gender pay gap; gross wage; salary - variable components
Background
Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms states the following:
‘PAY: the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other remuneration, whether in cash
or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly (“complementary or variable
components”) in respect of his/her employment from his/her employer. “Pay level” means gross
annual pay and the corresponding gross hourly pay. “Median pay level” means the pay of the
employee that would have half of the employees earn more and half less than they do’.
Disclosure Requirement S1-16 includes the following paragraphs on remuneration metrics (pay
gap and total remuneration):
‘95. The undertaking shall disclose the percentage gap in pay between its female and male
employees and the ratio between the remuneration of its highest paid individual and the median
remuneration for its employees.’
‘97. The disclosure required by paragraph 95 shall include: (a) the gender pay gap, defined as the
difference of average pay levels between female and male employees, expressed as a percentage
of the average pay level of male employees . . .’
‘98. The undertaking may disclose a breakdown of the gender pay gap as defined in paragraph
97 (a) by employee category and/or by country/segment. The undertaking may also disclose the
gender pay gap between employees by categories of employees broken down by ordinary basic
salary and complementary or variable components’.
ESRS S1 paragraph 97 includes additional information in a footnote as follows: ‘The gender pay
gap information supports the information needs of: financial market participants subject to
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 229 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 because it is derived from a mandatory indicator related to principal
adverse impacts as set out by indicator #12 in Table I of Annex I of Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 with regard to disclosure rules on sustainable investments
(“Unadjusted gender pay gap”); and benchmark administrators to disclose ESG factors subject to
Regulation (EU) 2020/1816 as set out by indicator “Weighted average gender pay gap” in Section
1 and 2 of Annex II.’
Answer
Complementary and variable components of the employee’s remuneration package form part of
the calculation. Annex II Acronyms and Glossary of Terms defines ‘pay’ as the salary and other
remuneration in cash or in kind that the employee directly or indirectly receives in respect of
his/her employment.
ESRS S1-16 AR 98 describes the methodology to follow when calculating the gender pay gap
required by ESRS S1-16 paragraph 97 (a). The value to be used in the ratio is the gross hourly pay
level.

Answer
No, all male and female employees have to be included in the calculation of the gender pay gap
regardless of whether they are covered by collective agreements or not.
Collective agreements can set equal levels of wages and benefits for both male and female
employees (provided that all components of the definition of ‘pay’ are included in the calculation,
the gender pay gap broken down by employee categories would be negligible). The undertaking
may explain this when providing relevant contextual information under ESRS S1 paragraph 97 (c).

potential impact on those individuals to be assessed under S2 or S4? For example, a harbor has
ferry services and a truck driver who, having to use in their job a ferry to deliver goods, gets injured
because of lack of security in the harbor. Is the impact on that driver to be assessed under S2
(because the truck driver is considered to be a worker in the downstream value chain) or S4
(because the truck driver is considered an end user)?’
The ESRS define end users as individuals ‘who ultimately use or are intended to ultimately use a
particular product or service’. A value chain worker is defined as an ‘individual performing work in
the value chain of the undertaking, regardless of the existence or nature of any contractual
relationship with the undertaking’. This includes ‘all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and
downstream value chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking (see Table 2
of Annex II of ESRS)’.
ESRS S1 Own Workforce, Disclosure Requirement S1-14 deals with reporting requirements for
work-related injuries and work-related cases of ill health, including those that involve workers from
companies other than the reporting undertaking as well as cases of work-related injuries and ill
health that happen during travel for working purposes. ESRS S1 paragraph 86 states that, apart
from cases of work-related injury and ill health among its own workforce, the reporting
undertaking must ‘also disclose the number of fatalities as a result of work-related injuries and
work-related ill health of other workers working on the undertaking’s sites’ (emphasis added).
ESRS S1 paragraph AR 84 states that an undertaking must also report incidents that happen to its
workforce while travelling for work, i.e. outside the undertaking’s own premises: ‘With regard to
travelling for work purposes, injuries and ill health that occur while a person is travelling are work-
related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the person was engaged in work activities “in the
interest of the employer”. Examples of such activities include travelling to and from customer
contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or
promote business (at the direction of the employer).’
Answer
ESRS define ‘end users’ as ‘individuals who ultimately use’ a product or service. In the fact pattern
accompanying the question, which is reproduced in ‘Background’, this does not include workers
of a business customer of the reporting undertaking. Those workers may use services offered by
the undertaking, but they do so in the context of providing a service or producing a good on behalf
of their employers. Typically, such workers should be considered value chain workers.
In general terms, there can be circumstances where an undertaking’s negative impacts are the
same for workers in the value chain and end users. In any case, whatever the characteristics of
each situation, the undertaking must avoid double-counting the same impact by reporting it once
as an impact on its value chain workers and a second time as an impact on end users. When
appropriate, disclosing the approach used as contextual information may provide useful
information.

Question ID 479 – Minimum disclosure requirements and ESRS G1
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
Do MDRs have to be applied for matters that are to be reported following the ESRS G1?
ESRS reference
ESRS G1; ESRS 2 Section 4.2 paragraphs 63 to 81
Key terms
Minimum disclosure requirements
Background
ESRS 2 Section 4.2, paragraph 60 states that Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) should ‘. .
. be included when the undertaking discloses information on its policies and actions to prevent,
mitigate and remediate actual and potential material impacts, to address material risks and/or to
pursue material opportunities (collectively, to “manage material sustainability matters”). They
shall be applied together with the Disclosure Requirements, including Application Requirements,
provided in the relevant topical and sector-specific ESRS.’
ESRS 2 Section 4.2, paragraph 70 establishes that Minimum Disclosure Requirements ‘shall be
included when the undertaking discloses information on its metrics and targets related to each
material sustainability matter. They shall be applied together with the Disclosure Requirements,
including Application Requirements, provided in the relevant topical ESRS.’
All the MDRs that shall be read in conjunction with the relevant topical ESRS, including those
affecting Policies, Actions, Targets and Metrics, are established in paragraphs 63 to 81 of ESRS 2.
Answer
The MDRs from paragraphs 63 to 81 in ESRS 2 shall be applied with respect to Policies, Actions,
Targets and Metrics in G1 irrespective of the fact that there is no cross-reference in the topical
standard.

ESRS G1-4 Incidents of corruption or bribery
Question ID 417 - Convictions
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
What is the definition to be used for ‘convictions’? It could be different things: Number of
convictions of proceeding that are still open? Or started in the reporting year? Closed in the
reporting year? Appeal concluded? Not subject to appeal anymore?
ESRS reference
ESRS G1-4 paragraph 24 (a)
Key terms
Convictions
Background
ESRS G1 paragraph 24 states that: ‘The undertaking shall disclose:
(a) the number of convictions and the amount of fines for violation of anti-corruption and
anti- bribery laws; and
(b) any actions taken to address breaches in procedures and standards of anti-corruption
and anti-bribery.’
Based on EU Law and on the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), the term
‘conviction’ is defined as ‘any final decision of a criminal court against a natural person in respect
of a criminal offence, to the extent that the decision is entered in the criminal records of the
convicting Member State’.
Answer
ESRS G1 uses the definition of ‘convictions’ derived from European Law. Based on EU Law and on
the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), the term conviction is defined as ‘any
final decision of a criminal court against a natural person in respect of a criminal offence, to the
extent that the decision is entered in the criminal records of the convicting Member State’.
Therefore, the disclosure requirement applies to the number of convictions that fulfil the
definition of a final decision of a criminal court. This is understood in the general sense of the
term, i.e., that of the court of the first instance. This approach has the advantage of including all
the convictions in the reporting while awaiting the outcome of a possible appeal. The reporting
undertaking may provide additional information if an appeal is considered, has been lodged or
was successful as this would be relevant information to users.

Question ID 800 – Corruption and Bribery
Release date
November 2024
Question asked
Does an undertaking need to disclose the total number of incidents of corruption and the total
number of incidents of bribery, or is there some additional data needed about the ‘nature’ of each
type of incident?
ESRS Reference
ESRS G1-4 paragraphs 24 and 25
Key terms
Corruption; bribery
Background
ESRS G1 paragraph 24 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose:
(a) the number of convictions and the amount of fines for violation of anti-corruption and
anti-bribery laws; and
(b) any actions taken to address breaches in procedures and standards of anti-corruption and
anti-bribery.’
ESRS G1 paragraph 25 states: ‘The undertaking may disclose:
(a) the total number and nature of confirmed incidents of corruption or bribery …’
Answer
There is no requirement to distinguish between convictions or fines for corruption and those for
bribery in paragraph 24 of ESRS G1. Additional information about the nature of the conviction or
fine is voluntary.
‘Confirmed incidents of corruption/bribery’ is the subject of voluntary disclosures per paragraph
25 of ESRS G1, which requires disclosure of the nature. There is no concept of ‘incidents of
corruption or bribery’ in ESRS.

ESRS G1-5 Political influence and lobbying activities
Question ID 510 – ESRS G1-5 Indirect political contributions and
lobbying activities
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
In ESRS G1-5, what is the dividing line between ‘indirect political contributions’, whose financial
or in-kind amounts must be disclosed according to paragraph 29 (b)(i) and AR 10, and ‘lobbying
activities’, whose financial or in-kind amounts may be disclosed as per AR 12?
ESRS reference
ESRS G1-5 paragraphs 29 (b), AR 10, and AR 12
Key terms
Political contributions, lobbying activities
Background
The concept of ‘political contributions’ is defined in AR 9 of ESRS G1-Business Conduct. This
paragraph states that political contributions refer to support provided directly to political parties,
their elected representatives or persons seeking political office.
The concept ‘indirect political contributions’ is defined in AR 10 of ESRS G1-Business Conduct. This
paragraph states that these refer to ‘those political contributions made through an intermediary
organisation such as a lobbyist or charity, or support given to an organisation such as a think tank
or trade association linked to or supporting particular political parties or causes.’
GRI, in its standard 415: Public Policy defines ‘indirect political contributions’ as ‘financial or in-
kind support to political parties, their representatives, or candidates for office made through an
intermediary organization such as a lobbyist or charity, or support given to an organization such
as a think tank or trade association linked to or supporting particular political parties or causes.’
The ESRS and GRI refer to ‘indirect political contributions’ as contributions linked to political
parties and political causes.
On the other hand, ‘lobbying activities’ as defined in Annex II of ESRS refer to ‘activities carried
out with the objective of influencing the formulation or implementation of policy or legislation,
or the decision-making processes of governments, governmental institutions, regulators,
European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or standard setters.’
Answer
Political contributions support political parties and/or election campaigns in their respective
political causes, and they can be direct or indirect. Indirect political contributions are made on
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 242 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
behalf of a company by an intermediary organisation, such as a think tank, a business association
or a charity. While political contributions are most commonly financial, e.g., donations, event
sponsorships or purchases of tickets at campaign or fundraising events, they can also be non-
financial (‘in kind’), e.g., providing certain services like printing of posters, website design or
permission to use facilities.
Lobbying, on the other hand, is about influencing policies, political decisions, laws and other
regulations, usually when they are being drafted or prepared but also in the implementation
stage. The typical targets of lobbying activities are therefore decision-makers in governments and
ministries, supervisory authorities and other government agencies as well as members of
parliaments and/or their assistants. Lobbying, too, can take direct or indirect forms. In the latter
case, the company entrusts the lobbying to a specialised service provider or to a not-for-profit
intermediary such as a business association.
Question ID 560 – Beneficiary of political contributions
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
Undertakings are required, for financial or in-kind political contributions, to report the total
monetary value of financial and in-kind political contributions made directly and indirectly by the
undertaking, aggregated by country or geographical area where relevant, as well as the type of
recipient/beneficiary. Does that include a requirement to disclose the exact name of the
beneficiary or simply its type?
ESRS reference
ESRS G1-5 paragraph 29 (b)
Key terms
Political contributions, beneficiary
Background
ESRS G1-5 paragraph 29 states the following: ‘The disclosure required by paragraph 27 shall
include … (b) for financial or in-kind political contributions: (i) the total monetary value of financial
and in-kind political contributions made directly and indirectly by the undertaking, aggregated by
country or geographical area where relevant, as well as type of recipient/beneficiary ...’
Answer
The Disclosure Requirement refers to the type of recipient/beneficiary and does not extend to
the name of the beneficiary.

Question ID 419 – Legal proceedings currently outstanding for late
payments
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
Regarding the number of currently outstanding legal proceedings for late payments, are you
referring to ‘currently outstanding’ that remained opened in the reporting year or also closed in
the reporting year?
ESRS reference
ESRS G1 paragraph 33 (c)
Key terms
Late payments; legal proceedings
Background
ESRS G1 paragraph 33 (c) refers to the ‘number of legal proceedings currently outstanding for late
payments’ when stating what the disclosure under paragraph 31 shall include, under G1-6
Payment Practices.
Answer
The Disclosure Requirement refers specifically to those legal proceedings that have not been
legally resolved at year-end. Further information or additional remarks regarding closed legal
proceedings related to late payments during the year may be disclosed under ESRS G1 paragraph
33 (d), which states that the undertaking shall disclose ‘complementary information necessary to
provide sufficient context’.
Question ID 444 - Payment practices
Release date
May 2024
Question asked

expected regarding SMEs or a wider range of suppliers?
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 244 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS reference
ESRS G1-6
Key terms
Payment practices; late payments
Background
ESRS G1 paragraph 2 presents the list of matters covered in the standard, which are collectively
referred to as ‘business conduct or business conduct matters’. Paragraph 2 (b) clarifies that ‘the
management of relationships with suppliers, including payment practices, especially with regard
to late payments to small and medium-sized undertakings’.
Disclosure Requirement G1-6 paragraph 31 states that ‘the undertaking shall provide information
on its payment practices’.
ESRS G1 paragraph 32 states that ‘The objective of this Disclosure Requirement (G1-6) is to
provide insights on the contractual payment terms and on its performance with regard to
payment, especially as to how these impact SMEs and specifically with respect to late payments
to SMEs.’
Answer
The information on payment practices is not limited to SMEs but regarding all suppliers.
However, the list of ‘shall’ data points in ESRS G1 paragraph 33 has to be read in the context of
the disclosure objective, which refers ‘especially’ to SMEs. Undertakings are expected, as part of
ESRS G1 paragraph 33 (d), to provide complementary information, if material, to provide sufficient
context, including information on payment practices specific to SMEs; for example, because there
are significant differences in payment practices vis-a-vis large and SME business partners.

Questions related to XBRL and datapoints
Question ID 326 – Implementation of datapoints
Release date
May 2024
Question asked
Why are some ESRS paragraphs and Application Requirements (AR) implemented as separate
datapoints in IG 3 List of ESRS Datapoints and some are not?
ESRS reference
IG 3 List of ESRS Data Points
Key terms
List of datapoints
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 16 states: ‘ESRS structure the information to be disclosed under Disclosure
Requirements. Each Disclosure Requirement consists of one or more distinct datapoints. The term
“datapoint” can also refer to a narrative sub-element of a Disclosure Requirement.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 18 states: ‘ESRS use the following terms to distinguish between different
degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose information:
(a) “shall disclose” – indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement
or datapoint;
(b) “may disclose” – indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice.
In addition, ESRS use the term “shall consider” when referring to issues resources or
methodologies that the undertaking is expected to take into account or to use in the preparation
of a given disclosure if applicable.’
IG 3 List of ESRS Data Points – Explanatory note and the ESRS XBRL Taxonomy provide non-
authoritative implementation guidance on the datapoints required by ESRS. It supports the
application of sector-agnostic ESRS adopted as delegated act on 31 July 2023 (see EFRAG IG 3 List
of ESRS data points – Explanatory note chapter Content and objective of this Implementation
Guidance).
ESRS E1 paragraph 36 states: ‘The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an
understanding of the undertaking’s total energy consumption in absolute value, improvement in
energy efficiency, exposure to coal, oil and gas-related activities, and the share of renewable
energy in its overall energy mix.’
Compilation of Explanations January—November 2024 Page 246 of 278
ESRS Implementation Q&A Platform – Compilation of Explanations January – November 2024
ESRS E1 paragraph AR36 states: ‘When preparing the information on energy intensity required
under paragraph 40, the undertaking shall:
(a) calculate the energy intensity ratio using the following formula: …‘
ESRS E1 paragraph AR38 states: ‘The reconciliation of net revenue from activities in high climate
impact sectors to the relevant financial statements line item or disclosure (as required by
paragraph 43) may be presented either:
(a) by a cross-reference to the related line item or disclosure in the financial statements;
or
(b) if the net revenue cannot be directly cross-referenced to a line item or disclosure in
the financial statements, by a quantitative reconciliation using the below tabular
format. …‘
Answer
IG 3 List of Data Points – Explanatory note (as well as the ESRS XBRL Taxonomy) have dedicated
and separate items only for the individual datapoints of ESRS Disclosure Requirements. The
datapoints are often indicated by terms equal or similar to ‘shall disclose’, ‘shall describe’ or ‘may
disclose’. All paragraphs of ESRS 1, and some paragraphs and Application Requirements of the
other topical ESRS, provide objectives, methodological guidance or other guidance that are to be
considered when preparing or disclosing sustainability statements according to ESRS. Those
paragraphs are not implemented as separate datapoints.
The following examples illustrate when paragraphs in ESRS are considered separate datapoints or
not:
(a) ESRS E1 paragraph 36: Not a datapoint because it describes the objective of the disclosure
requirement E1-5 on Energy Consumption.
(b) ESRS E1 paragraph AR 36: Not a data point because it provides calculation guidance on
the energy consumption.
(c) ESRS E1 paragraph AR 38, implemented as separate data point, due to the character of
the Application Requirement which defines how the reconciliation of net revenue from
activities in high climate impact sectors to the relevant financial statements line item or
disclosure may be presented.
(d) Application Requirements that are part of the narrative disclosure of their associated
Disclosure Requirements or datapoint are not designated as separate datapoints. An
example would be ESRS E1 paragraph 20 (a) and the related AR 9, detailing the
information to be provided under ESRS E1 paragraph 20 (a).
(e) Application Requirements marked with ‘shall consider’ have not been included as
separate datapoints, e.g., ESRS 2 paragraph AR 14 relating to ESRS 2 paragraph 42.

In the VC coverage map it is indicated, under item 4, that: "The undertaking shall reflect whether and how
policies, actions or targets cover VC." One of the items mentioned here is S1-1 to S1-5. It is unclear to me VCIG, chapter 4, VC IG 2 Value Chain

why these DR's would refer to VC, as S1 typically applies to "own workforce". S1-1 to S1-17 is also mentioned map, paragraph 155 paragraph 184
