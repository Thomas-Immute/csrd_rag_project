[draft] GRI-ESRS Interoperability Index
About this [draft] index
Crediting the close cooperation during the development of the draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), EFRAG and
GRI have acknowledged that they have achieved a high level of interoperability between the ESRS and GRI Standards in relation to
impact reporting. This [draft] index is prepared from an EU standpoint where entities in scope of the CSRD will be subject to the
mandatory regime defined by the ESRS, including disclosures and definitions where requirements of topical standards are subject to a
materiality assessment of matters and information. Therefore, this [draft] Interoperability Index is a mapping tool that helps entities
understand the commonalities between the two sustainability reporting standards in regard to impacts.
Given the high level of interoperability achieved, entities reporting under ESRS can be considered as reporting ‘with reference’ to the
GRI Standards (see GRI 1: Foundation 2021). The [draft] index shows the relationship between the ESRS and GRI disclosures to
facilitate reporting ‘with reference’ to the GRI Standards.
When performing its materiality assessment, an ESRS reporter may conclude that some of the matters and disclosures that are not
specifically addressed by ESRS and are identified as a difference with the GRI Standards, might be reported in the ESRS sustainability
statement as entity-specific disclosures, when the conditions in ESRS 1 paragraph 11 are met.
The [draft] index may also support ESRS reporters that want to report ‘in accordance’ with the GRI Standards (see GRI 1: Foundation
2021), in which case they would have to report the additional applicable GRI requirements not covered by the ESRS in their
sustainability statement, in accordance with the provisions of ESRS 1 paragraph 114.
To further simplify reporting processes, EFRAG and GRI are working on a digital correspondence table to achieve digital
interoperability for the ESRS and GRI Standards. Shared disclosures tagged under the ESRS digital taxonomy and the GRI digital
taxonomy could be cross-referenced to allow for a streamlined digital reporting exercise on the preparer’s side.
How to use the [draft] index
04-02 [draft] ESRS-GRI Interoperability SR TEG meeting 5 December
This [draft] Interoperability Index follows a columnar format mapping the GRI Standards disclosures to the corresponding ESRS
disclosure requirements at a granular level. The columns called ‘Notes’ and ‘Explanation’ describe the differences that arise at
datapoint level. These differences do not impair the overall objective of entities reporting under ESRS, that prepare their ESRS
sustainability statement, effectively claiming to report ‘with reference’ to the GRI Standards.
For ease of reading:
• Where column D and E are blank, no differences are highlighted.
• Column D includes a categorisation system to clearly explain the nature of the identified differences. These differences, which may
affect only a single datapoint of a given disclosure requirement, have been classified in three groups: (1) differences in granularity or
data type; (2) differences in scope; and (3) differences in definition.
• In column C, there are several instances where GRI Standards disclosures are not covered by the list of sustainability matters in
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16; in particular, in relation to the provisions of the CSRD (for instance, on certain governance matters such as
tax transparency). These instances are highlighted with light grey.

(1a) Differences in granularity: GRI requires further breakdowns or granularity.
(1b) Differences in data type: GRI requires quantitative disclosure and ESRS requires qualitative disclosure.
(2a) Differences in scope: GRI disclosure is broader and/or more specific than ESRS.
(2b) Differences in scope: GRI and ESRS disclosures have the same disclosure objective but differ in how data points are formulated.
(2c) Differences in scope: GRI 403 covers employees and workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled
by the organization. ESRS S1-14 covers employees and non-employee workers (people with contracts with the undertaking to supply
labour (“self-employed people”) or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78)). For
fatalities, ESRS S1-14 covers workers working on the undertaking’s sites.
(3) Difference in definition of non-employees: GRI 2-8 covers workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the
organization. ESRS S1-7 covers non-employee workers (people with contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self-employed
people”) or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78)).
