[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
Objective and structure of this [draft] standard
1. Consistent with ESRS 1 paragraph 10, the objective of this [draft] ESRS is to specify
disclosure and application requirements that enable users of sustainability statements to
understand material impacts, risks and opportunities, that are likely to be material for
all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered,
by topical standards. This [draft] ESRS covers the sustainability matters that are most
relevant to the Oil and Gas sector.
2. This [draft] ESRS specifies disclosure and application requirements as follows:
(a) additional sector-specific datapoints and/or application requirements related to
sector-agnostic disclosure requirements. Additional datapoints are located in the
main body of this standard and additional Application Requirements are located in
Appendix B. In both cases, they are identified by having in their title the
requirement of sector-agnostic ESRS to which they relate (e.g. ESRS2.IRO2.OG).
(b) sector-specific Disclosure Requirements are presented in the main body of this
[draft] standard and are identified by a progressive numbering (OG 1, OG 2, etc.).
Their Application Requirements are presented in Appendix B.
3. The requirements classified in this [draft] standard as policies, actions and targets are
subject to the materiality provisions of paragraph 33 of ESRS 1. Those classified as
metrics are subject to the materiality provisions of paragraph 34 of ESRS 1. When
assessing additional sector-specific datapoints in this [draft] standard referred to in
paragraph 2 (a) above for the condition of paragraph 34 (b) of ESRS 1, the undertaking
shall refer to the objective of the relevant Disclosure Requirement in the sector agnostic
standards.
3.1. The requirements of this standard shall be applied in conjunction with SEC1 that specifies
general requirements and disclosure applicable to all sectors.
Scope of application
4. An undertaking is within the scope of application of this [draft] ESRS when Oil and Gas is
a significant sector according to paragraph 40 (b) and/or (c) of ESRS 2 General
Disclosures, using the criteria set in AR 13 of ESRS 2 to define a significant sector, as well
as according to paragraph [#] of [Draft] SEC 1.
5. [draft] ESRS SEC 1 Sector classification defines the aggregation of activities (NACE
codes) into sectors for the purposes of applying sector ESRS. The NACE codes that
pertain to the Oil and Gas sector are listed in Appendix D to this [draft] ESRS, consistent
with [Draft] SEC 1.
6. The Oil and Gas sector is composed of upstream, midstream, downstream and service
sub-sectors. The undertakings operating within these sub-sectors are referred respectively
to as upstream-, downstream-, midstream- and service undertakings, according to the
definitions in Appendix A of this [draft] ESRS.
7. Oil and Gas upstream sub-sector refer to the undertakings carrying out activities of
development, exploration and production of conventional and unconventional oil and gas
reserves. Unconventional development includes the mining and extraction of oil sands,
shale oil and gas, deep sea exploration and fracking, among other techniques. Activities
of developing and/or operating oil and gas fields occur both for on-shore and off-shore
reserves. Activities in this sub-sector are classified under NACE B.06.10 Extraction of
crude petroleum and B.06.20 Extraction of natural gas.
8. Oil and Gas midstream sub-sector covers undertakings carrying out activities that include
the transportation and storage of natural gas, crude oil, and refined petroleum products.
Activities involve gathering, transporting and processing of natural gas as well as transport
of crude oil and refined products over land (pipelines, truck and rail) or water (tankers and
barges). Includes also storage terminals stocking oil and gas above and below ground.
Activities in this sub-sector are classified under NACE H.49.50 Transport via pipeline.
9. Oil and Gas downstream sub-sector refers to undertakings carrying out activities that
include refining (classified under NACE C.19.20) and marketing of petroleum products,
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 5 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
including operating gas stations and convenience stores (classified under NACE G.46.71
and G.47.30), as well as activities of agents involved in the wholesale of fuels (G.46.12).
10. Oil and Gas services sub-sector refers to undertakings that provide support activities and
equipment to the Oil and Gas value-chain. Services include activities such as drilling,
completing and equipping oil and gas on-shore and off-shore wells, as well as seismic
surveying, well cementing and well monitoring. Services are usually provided on a
contractual basis, and equipment is either purchased, leased or rented. Activities in this
sub-sector are classified under NACE include B.09.10 Support activities for petroleum and
natural gas extraction.
11. Integrated oil and gas undertakings are involved in activities in more than one of the above
sub-sectors, typically across upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Such
undertakings may need to report disclosure requirements and data points for each of the
activities or apply specific disclosure requirements or data points.
12. The reference to NACE activities above is made to demonstrate key activities in the sector.
It is noted that undertakings belonging to this sector may carry out a range of additional
activities, such as the production of hydrogen, biofuels, or utilisation of carbon capture and
storage.
Presentation of sector-specific disclosures [MOVE TO SEC 1]
13. Disclosures stemming from the [draft] Oil and Gas ESRS shall be presented alongside the
disclosures required by the corresponding sector-agnostic ESRS and following the
provisions prescribed by ESRS 1, paragraph 116.

Appendix A: Defined terms
This appendix is an integral part of this Exposure Draft and has the same authority as the other
parts of this Exposure Draft.
Term Description
Biosphere Biosphere reserves are ‘learning places for sustainable development’. They
Reserves are sites for testing interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and
recognised managing changes and interactions between social and ecological systems,
within the including conflict prevention and management of biodiversity. They are places
framework that provide local solutions to global challenges. Biosphere reserves include
of terrestrial, marine, and coastal ecosystems. Each site promotes solutions
UNESCO’s reconciling the conservation of biodiversity with its sustainable use.
Man and the Biosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under
Biosphere the sovereign jurisdiction of the states where they are located. Biosphere
(MAB) Reserves are designated under the intergovernmental MAB Programme by the
Programme Director-General of UNESCO following the decisions of the MAB International
Coordinating Council (MAB ICC). Their status is internationally recognized.
Conflict- Areas in a state of armed conflict or fragile post-conflict as well as areas
affected and witnessing weak or non-existent governance and security, such as failed
high-risk states, and widespread and systematic violations of international law, including
areas human rights abuses.
Decommissi 1) The action of withdrawing from service the offshore facilities and
oning infrastructure, and the Plugging & Abandonment (P&A) of offshore wells.
activities 2) Decommissioning is the process of ending offshore oil and gas operations
at an offshore platform and returning the ocean and seafloor to its pre-lease
condition.
Developed Reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and facilities.
reserves Developed reserves may be further sub-classified as producing or non-
producing. Developed producing reserves are the developed reserves that are
expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and
producing at the effective date. Improved recovery reserves are considered
producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. Developed
non-producing reserves are the developed reserves that are either shut-in or
behind-pipe.
Downstrea Undertakings active in refining and marketing of petroleum products, including
m operation of gas stations and convenience stores (NACE codes C.19.20,
undertaking G.46.71 and G.47.30). As such, the downstream undertakings referred to in
(s) this standard shall be understood differently from downstream value chain
actors (e.g. customers) used to describe business relationships.
Drilling Extractive residues commonly generated during exploration and production of
waste oil and gas, both onshore and offshore. The main types of drilling waste
include drilling cuttings, drilling fluids and interfacial mixtures. Drill cuttings are
particles of crushed rock sand, silt and clay produced by the action of the
rotary drill bit as it penetrates into the earth. Drilling fluids, also referred to as
‘muds’, and are mixtures of fine-grained solids, inorganic salts, and organic
compounds dissolved or dispersed/suspended in in a ‘continuous phase’ (the
base fluid) which may be water (water-based muds) or an organic liquid (non-
aqueous muds, which can be oil-based or synthetic-based). Interfacial
mixtures are more commonly referred to as ‘slops’. Slop water or slop mud are
produced when the drilling fluid becomes contaminated with water; or an
aqueous fluid (such as a completion brine) becomes contaminated with NADF
or reservoir hydrocarbons.

Environmen The term "environmental defenders” refers to individuals and groups who, in
tal their personal or professional capacity and in a peaceful manner, strive to
defenders
protect and promote human rights relating to the environment, including water,
air, land, flora and fauna. Land and environmental rights are interlinked and are
often inseparable. As a result, the two broad categories of defenders advocating
for the environment and for land rights are often characterized as “land and
environmental rights defenders”, “environmental rights defenders”, or just
“environmental activists”.
Fugitive Gas leakages directly into the atmosphere through valves and seals, hoses
emissions and flexible piping, as well as evaporation from hydrocarbon liquids and from
cuttings. Fugitive emissions can never be fully eliminated, but can be
minimised by use of good / appropriate materials, equipment and design, as
well as through good operating procedures.
High-risk High-risk areas are those where there is a high risk of conflict or of widespread
area(s) or serious abuses as defined in paragraph 1 of Annex II of the OECD
Guidance. Such areas are often characterized by political instability or
repression, institutional weakness, insecurity, collapse of civil infrastructure,
widespread violence, and violations of national or international law.
Hydraulic During hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic fracturing fluid is injected down an oil or
fracturing gas production well and into the targeted rock formation under pressures great
fluid enough to fracture the oil- and gas-bearing rock. The hydraulic fracturing fluid
usually carries proppant (typically sand) into the newly created fractures to
keep the fractures “propped” open. After hydraulic fracturing, oil, gas, and
other fluids flow through the fractures and up the production well to the
surface, where they are collected and managed.
Hydrocarbo A liquid petroleum hydrocarbon discharged, accidentally or intentionally, that
n spill(s) floats on the surface of water bodies as a discrete mass and is carried by the
wind, currents and tides. Hydrocarbon spills can be partially controlled by
chemical dispersion, combustion, mechanical containment and adsorption.
They have destructive effects on coastal ecosystems. (See also accidental
and non-accidental release).
Human right The term “human rights defenders” refers to individuals, groups and organs of
defenders society that promote and protect universally recognised human rights and
fundamental freedoms. Human rights defenders seek the promotion and
protection of civil and political rights as well as the promotion, protection and
realisation of economic, social and cultural rights. Human rights defenders also
promote and protect the rights of members of groups such as indigenous
communities. The definition does not include those individuals or groups who
commit or propagate violence.
Midstream Undertakings active in the transportation and storage of natural gas, crude oil
undertaking and refined petroleum products (NACE code H.49.50)
(s)
Migrant A person who is to be engaged, is engaged or has been engaged in a
worker remunerated activity in a state of which they are not nationals.

Probable Probable reserves (or P2) are those additional reserves which are less likely to
reserves be recovered than proven reserves (<90%) but more certain to be recovered
than possible reserves (>50%).
Produced Water (brine) obtained from the hydrocarbon bearing formation strata during
water the extraction of oil and gas. This can include formation water, injection water,
and any chemicals added downhole or during the oil/ water separation
process.
Proven Proven reserves (or P1) are the amount of oil or natural resources contained
reserves under a piece of land with a 90% or greater probability of profitable extraction.
Reserves Part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or
produced at the time of the reserve determination.
Scale and 1) Thick, soft, wet mud or a similar viscous mixture of liquid and solid
sludges components.
2) Sludge is composed of dissolved solids which precipitate from produced
water as its temperature and pressure change. Sludge generally consists of
oily, loose material often containing silica compounds, but may also contain
large amounts of barium.
Scales are normally found on the inside of piping and tubing. American
Petroleum Institute found that the highest concentrations of radioactivity are in
the scale in wellhead piping and in production piping near the wellhead.
Concentrations were as high as tens of thousands of picocuries per gram.
However, the largest volumes of scale occur in three areas: Water lines
associated with separators, (separate gas from the oil and water; Heater
treaters (divide the oil and water phases); Gas dehydrators, where scale
deposits as thick as four inches may accumulate.

maintain and improve safety and manage risk.
Transmissio Pipelines used to transport crude oil and natural gas from their respective
n pipelines gathering systems to refining, processing, or storage facilities. Transmission
pipelines also transport refined petroleum products and natural gas to
customers, for use or for further distribution. With very few exceptions,
transmission pipelines are dedicated to the transportation of crude oil, refined
petroleum products, or natural gas. Transmission pipeline systems include all
of the equipment and facilities necessary to transport the products. This
includes the pipe, valves, pumps or compressors, breakout tanks, storage
tanks, refining and processing facilities and other equipment and facilities.
Transmission pipelines are constructed from steel pipe and can range in size
from several inches to several feet in diameter. Depending on the product
being transported, transmission pipeline systems can be designed to operate
from relatively low pressures to high pressures. They can range in length from
hundreds of feet to hundreds of miles.
Undergroun An Underground Storage Tank (UST) system is a tank (or a combination of
d storage tanks) and connected underground piping having at least 10 percent of their
tank(s) combined volume underground. The tank system includes the tank,
underground connected piping, underground ancillary equipment, and any
containment system.
Undevelope Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are
d reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting
development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when
drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes
reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only
if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to
be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer
time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be
attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other
improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have
been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous
reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing
reasonable certainty.
Upstream Undertakings active in development, exploration and production of
undertaking conventional and unconventional oil and gas reserves (NACE codes B.06.10
(s) and B.06.20). As such, the upstream undertakings referred to in this
standard shall be understood differently from upstream value chain actors (e.g.
suppliers) used to describe business relationships.

Appendix B: Application Requirements
This Appendix is an integral part of the proposed [draft] ESRS Oil and Gas and has the same
authority as the other parts of the Standard.
Sustainability matters included in the materiality assessment
AR 1. This sector standard introduce two cross-cutting sustainability matters which play a role
in the undertaking’s materiality assessment:
(a) industrial hazards, which refer to incidents and accidents oil and gas operations
are highly prone to and which can result in significant impacts on environmental
resources (extreme contamination of air, water and soil, habitat degradation, harm
to species), surrounding communities and infrastructures (e.g., damage to
economic activities and food resources), workers (e.g., injuries, ill health, fatalities),
as well as undertaking’s assets, leading to critical financial repercussions. Some
examples of industrial hazards include well blowout and explosions due to the
manipulation of volatile and combustible chemicals, unintended leaks and failed
containment of hazardous and highly reactive substances (e.g., hydrocarbons,
hydraulic fracturing fluids) spills. The establishment of a system and a culture of
safety, including through emergency preparedness and control, may help
undertakings to reduce the risk of such hazards.
(b) closure of assets, which refer to ceasing of the operations, whenever site-specific
extractive operations such as those in oil and gas are subject to closure due to
finite resources and/or economic viability. At the end-of-life of an operation, the
expectation is that the site will be restored to pre-development ecological
functionality and setting or at least stabilized to prevent persistent environmental
and social impact associated with geomorphological changes, increased
contamination, and deteriorated safety conditions. Decommissioning planning,
including financial allocation, is critical to ensure detrimental effects to
environmental and social values are fully addressed and mitigated. As such,
corporate financial disclosure for decommissioning is essential to demonstrate
public accountability for businesses in the extractives sector. The term asset in this
definition does not relate to resources that would meet the financial accounting
definition of asset.
AR 2. Whenever a cross-cutting sustainability matter is identified, the likelihood of occurrence
for number of other sustainability matters is increasing, as illustrated in the table below.
Upon the conclusion of materiality of cross-cutting sustainability matters, the undertaking
shall evaluate the connected sustainability matters.

Appendix F: Description of sustainability matters
This Appendix complements the [draft] ESRS Oil and Gas and presents a non-binding description of
the sustainability matters that are most relevant for undertakings in the Oil and Gas sector.
For the sustainability matters that are also listed in paragraph AR16 of ESRS 1, this Appendix
provides a description of how such matters materialise in this specific sector.
Industrial hazards
Oil and gas operations are highly prone to incidents and accidents with disastrous impacts on
environmental resources (extreme contamination of air, water and soil, habitat degradation, harm to
species), surrounding communities and infrastructures (e.g., damage to economic activities and food
resources), workers (e.g., injuries, ill health, fatalities), as well as undertaking’s assets, leading to
critical financial repercussions. Some examples of industrial hazards include well blowout and
explosions due to the manipulation of volatile and combustible chemicals, unintended leaks and failed
containment of hazardous and highly reactive substances (e.g., hydrocarbons, hydraulic fracturing
fluids) spills. The establishment of a system and a culture of safety, including through emergency
preparedness and control, may help undertakings to reduce the risk of such hazards.
Closure of assets
Site-specific extractive operations such as those in oil and gas are subject to closure due to finite
resources and/or economic viability. At the end-of-life of an operation, the expectation is that the site
will be restored to pre-development ecological functionality and setting or at least stabilized to prevent
persistent environmental and social impact associated with geomorphological changes, increased
contamination, and deteriorated safety conditions. Decommissioning planning, including financial
allocation, is critical to ensure detrimental effects to environmental and social values are fully
addressed and mitigated. As such, corporate financial disclosure for decommissioning is essential to
demonstrate public accountability for businesses in the extractives sector. The term asset in this
definition does not relate to resources that would meet the financial accounting definition of asset.
E1: Climate change
Climate change adaptation
The sector is exposed to a range of risks from the current and future climate variability. Those risks
may include, for example, reduced window of time for tundra travel due to the permafrost melting,
increased lighting strikes in northern latitudes, coastal erosion leading to degradation of barriers,
increased storms and wave loading on offshore facilities, changes in precipitation patterns affecting
the water management or flooding, and reduced certainty regarding efficiency of equipment.
Thorough risk evaluation and assessment as well as working towards resilience across the whole
value chain, including surrounding communities and infrastructure, are essential to manage risk and
opportunities related to the matters of climate change adaptation.
Climate change mitigation
Sector’s GHG emissions are major contributor to climate change. Depending on the activity specifics,
actions to reduce emissions may cover areas of fugitive methane emissions, flaring of natural gas,
but also mitigation of other GHG releases such as N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF or NF. Climate transition
efforts for the sector extend across the whole value chain, including the Scope 3 emissions. Change
to a low-carbon economy is linked to multiple aspects of climate change mitigation (emissions
management, long-term decline in demand, presence of stranded assets) and investments in
renewable energy, technologies to remove CO from the atmosphere, as well as implementation of
2
nature-based solutions, such as reforestation, afforestation, coastal and wetland restoration.
Energy
The oil and gas sector represents an energy-intensive industry and hence energy efficiency and
savings are essential to the industry’s operations. Examples of energy-consuming equipment used
within the sector may include boilers, fired heaters, waste incinerators, gas turbines, gas engines and
diesel engines. On-site generation of non-fossil energy, new sources of electric power or other non-
combustion energy sources can represent an opportunity for managing the energy transition. The
energy efficiency and energy consumption factors remain critical matters to be managed to minimise
negative climate impacts of the industry.
Methane
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 49 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. It can be emitted from
different activities within oil and gas industry. Examples of operations that can lead to its releases are
operations of wells, oil and gas platforms, transmission through the pipelines, storage, refining or
distribution activities. The methane emissions can be originating from the intentional methane burning
(flaring), intentional releases directly into the air (venting) or fugitive emissions. Overall methane
emissions in the industry can be significantly reduced thanks to the use of available technologies, as
well as dedicated leak detection and repairs programmes.
E2: Pollution
Pollution of air
Oil and gas operations (intentional, e.g., venting and flaring; or unintentional, e.g., fugitive emissions
form incidents or evaporation losses) contribute to air emissions that decrease air quality at local and
regional levels, resulting in negative impacts that acutely affect human health (e.g., neurological
damage), flora (e.g., impairing photosynthesis) and fauna or cultural heritage sites. While the impacts
associated with greenhouse gas emissions are taken in account as a part of the climate mitigation
topic, other significant air pollutants from regular oil and gas sectoral activities are relevant to consider
and may include (but are not limited to) SOx, NOx, H S, VOCs (contributing to the formation of smog,
2
and containing air toxics), PM. Monitoring and management of the impacts related to the air quality,
as well as an innovative approaches to improve performance in this regard are significant matters for
the industry.
Pollution of water
Oil and gas sector activities may result in water discharges, such as hydrocarbon liquids, acids,
biocides or muds. Water contamination can also occur from the injection of drilling fluids into wells
and flowback from hydraulic fracturing. Inefficient treatment of water discharges, oil spills from
transportation accidents, ruptured pipelines or seepage, or failure of an oil sands tailings dam can
cause severe and long-term impacts on (ground, surface, sea) water quality. Pollution can result from
regular activities or can be related to incidental spills and industrial hazards connected to operations,
infrastructure decommissioning or abandoned assets. Such incidents, events and catastrophes may
result in severe environmental and social consequences and trigger significant financial liabilities,
reputational damage and can be especially acute in areas of high-water stress.
Pollution of soil
Activities within the oil and gas sector (e.g., production and drilling), as well as pollution incidents and
catastrophes (e.g., accidental ore oil spills), can result in releases of harmful substance, vibration or
other contaminant into sand, silts, shells and gravel, as well as the underlying sediments and
groundwater resources. These contaminants lead to changes in the geotechnical properties of soils
(e.g., decreased permeability due to oil spills) and are persistent in the environment, resulting in
increasing soil toxicity over time, subsequently affecting pollutants accumulation in habitats and
organisms. Such pollutants can include heavy metals, cuttings, muds, hydrocarbon liquids or fluids
from drilling, as well as non-hydrocarbon substances, which result from regular activities or can be
related to incidental spills and industrial hazards connected to operations, infrastructure
decommissioning or abandoned assets.
Pollution of living organisms and food resources
Living organisms and food resources can be at risk of exposure to potential contamination with
pollutants present in the value chain of the oil and gas sector. Releases of hydrocarbons and other
types of contaminants into the air, water and soil may negatively impact the healthy development of
soils and plants and cause severe effects on marine and other living organisms which depend on
natural resources for survival, additionally impacting the availability of food resources. Monitoring and
management of pollution sources is therefore essential for avoiding negative environmental, social
and economic consequences for the industry.
Substances of concern
Multiple activities in the oil and gas sector may involve a large range of substances of concern which
need to be managed. The use of these substances is currently regulated and overseen under the
REACH and CLP regulations due to their human health and environmental impact. Some examples
of key substances in oil and gas operations include diesel particulate matter (e.g., powering drilling
equipment), hydrocarbon gases and vapours, crystalline silica (respirable).
Substances of very high concern
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 50 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
Certain activities in oil and gas may also involve a large range of substances of very high concern
(SVHC) which need to be managed by undertakings. Those substances are currently regulated and
overseen under REACH regulation due to their human health and environmental impact. Some
examples of key hazardous substances used during oil and gas exploration and extraction are oilfield
chemicals, drilling fluids and fracking fluids (containing a variety of compositions of chemicals,
potentially including endocrine disruptors), hydrogen sulfide, and naturally occurring radioactive
material (e.g. contaminated pipes and equipment containing pipe scales and drilling mud and sludge).
E3: Water and marine resources
Water withdrawals
Oil and gas activities have significant impacts on water availability. Specific sector activities may
withdraw large water quantities for extraction or processing methods, including the hydraulic
fracturing or oil sands mining. The scale of water withdrawals can vary depending on the activity, but
reinjection and reuse is playing critical role in minimizing the negative impacts. Given that the large
proportion of industrial activities takes place in the areas of high water stress, marked by increased
competition for water resources, management of risks along the whole supply chain is essential for
the sector to avoid significant environmental and social impacts connected with water availability and
quality.
Water consumption
The amounts of water that are not returned to the environment are relevant sustainability matter within
the sector and are referred as to consumed water. Impacts related to water consumption within oil
and gas industry may refer to water converted to waste, evaporated, transpired, or being polluted to
the point of being unusable by other users, which prevents it from being released back to surface
water, groundwater, seawater, or a third party over the course of the reporting period.
Water use
Oil and gas sector can use relatively large quantities of water depending on their size and the
complexity of the processes. This exposes the undertakings to the risk of reduced water availability,
depending on their location, and related costs. Usage of water from water-stressed regions may also
create tensions with local communities. Sustainable management of water often require wastewater
treatment and disposal, often via on-site wastewater treatment plants before discharge. Reducing
water use and contamination through recycling, other water management strategies, and use of non-
toxic fracturing fluids could create operational efficiency for companies and lower their operating
costs. Such strategies could also minimize the impacts that regulations, water supply shortages, and
community-related disruptions have on operations.
Water discharges in water bodies and in the oceans
The oil and gas industry handles large quantities of water, process wastewater and stormwater, which
can be then discharged to surface water, groundwater or seawater. These are normally treated to
remove contaminants before being discharged, in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Subsequent to that, water can be discharged into the receiving waterbody either at the defined
discharge points or dispersed in an undefined manner, it also can be authorized or unauthorized. The
quality of its discharges can have impacts on ecosystems and people. Constituents or measures for
discharges may include chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulphides, ammonia, phenols, total
suspended solids (TSS), or non-aqueous drilling fluids discharged).
Habitat degradation and intensity of pressure on marine resources
Leaks, accidental discharges, pipeline rights-of-way, and open easements over ecologically sensitive
land could impact ecosystems in several ways, including natural habitat loss and changes in species
movement. Impacts on the habitat degradation and intensity of pressure on marine resources can
result also from decommissioning offshore structures when elements that should be removed become
part of benthic communities and habitats. In some cases, decommissioning can occur in situ and
structures may be left in place. When this happens, impacts can include marine pollution from
corrosion, ecosystem changes, damage to fishing equipment, and navigational hazards to shipping.
E4: Biodiversity and ecosystems
Direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss
High impact activities in the sector include, but are not limited to land clearance, seismic testing,
drilling of exploration wells, infrastructure establishing, transportation, water and waste discharges,
spills and leaks. Such activities may result in contamination of air, soil and water, soil erosion, and
sedimentation of waterways, contributing to degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems. Considering
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 51 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
that biodiversity-related risks are likely to increase within the sector with progressing resources
depletion and moving of activities into new, more remote areas, it is essential to monitor and manage
the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts, within both short and long term.
Impacts on the state of species
Impacts on the state of species can include animal mortality or increased vulnerability to predators,
habitat fragmentation and conversion, as well as the introduction of invasive species and pathogens,
land degradation, or soil sealing. Severe effects from activities can be exacerbated when activities
occur in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value and may extend well beyond the closure
and rehabilitation of operational sites or geographic boundaries of activities.
Impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems
Due to its multiple potential direct and indicated impacts, sector activities can lead to significant land
degradation (e.g. due to pollution) and soil sealing (e.g. due to road construction, increased local
economic activity, etc), impacts that occur by same pressures that drive land-use change.
Impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services
Sector activities may affect ecosystems’ ability to regulate water flow, water quality, and hazards like
fires and floods, provide a suitable habitat for pollinators (who in turn provide a service directly to
people and economies), and sequester carbon (in terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms).
Monitoring of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on biodiversity in long and short term is therefore
of essential importance to environment, but is also vital to human health, food security, economic
prosperity, and mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its impacts.
E5: Resource and circular economy
Resources inflows, including resource use
The oil and gas sector activities are based on inflow of geologically stored fossil fuels, as well as on
the extensive use of other materials (steel and other metals, cement and concrete), including
environmental resources. Optimising resource exploitation, improving resource efficiency and
implementing effective ways of materials management are therefore critical to minimize local risks to
the environment and communities, as well as improve the cost efficiency. The opportunities for
efficient use of materials include renewable and alternative energy generation, implementing
responsibly produced materials in supply chain (e.g., recycled or biobased raw materials; easily
reusable, disassemblable or repairable materials or components) and optimisation of resources (e.g.,
advanced methane detection).
Resource outflows related to products and services
Resource outflows refer to materials, products and services coming out of the sector, including
petroleum products put on the market and their packaging, as well as used equipment and machinery
resulting from decommissioning activities. Opportunities aimed to enhance circular economy can
include, for instance, the increase in recirculation of tools from disused structures or the reuse of
facilities and assets that were removed from oil and gas operativity.
Waste
Regular oil and gas activities, the development of new facilities, as well as decommissioning of
infrastructure typically generates high volumes of waste, including hazardous waste. The waste
streams can consist of drilling muds and cuttings, tailings (e.g., oil sands mining generated during the
separation process of bitumen from sand), scale or sludges, which may contain high amounts of
pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, hydrocarbons, chemical additives, naturally radioactive material) and
carry the risks of environmental contamination (e.g., tailing ponds leaking substances). Undertaking’s
infrastructure and approach to waste management, including waste recovery for beneficial use (e.g.,
recycling of materials from disused facilities such as concrete and steel, plastic recycling, oil
regeneration), is, therefore, critical to avoid severe environmental impacts.
S1: Working time and work-life balance
Many operations in the oil and gas sector are typically operated in a manner that involves irregular
working hours for a large portion of the own workforce concerned. Operations such as production and
refining are operated continuously (around-the-clock, including on weekends). Shift work longer than
eight hours, and evening, night and weekend work are typically used in these types of operations.
Exploration, development and production frequently is done far away from populated areas (“remote
locations”), and undertakings often resort to arrangements whereby workers will rotate between multi-
day or multi-week periods on site, with few work breaks, and periods with time off off-site (“fly-in fly-
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 52 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
out” arrangements). In such remote locations adequate housing, access to water and sanitation and
health care are often material matters.
Research has demonstrated an association between extensive irregular working hours and time
without family, recreation, and leisure and negative impacts on physical and psychological health and
work-life balance. Extensive use of irregular working hours may make it difficult for undertakings to
retain their workers and recruit new workers.
S1: Adequate wages and secure employment
Many undertakings in the oil and gas sector make extensive use of non-employee workers, typically
referred to as ‘contractors’ - that is, self-employed workers contracting directly with the undertaking
or supplied by employment agencies as well as migrant workers. Many of these workers are utilized
for extended periods of time for regular operations, and perform work which is the same or similar to
the work that employees do. However, these workers lack the employment security and, frequently,
the wages and benefits that employees receive. Secure employment is also particularly material for
the oil and gas sector as non-employee workers may have fewer rights to unemployment and early
retirement benefits and access to retraining than employees when it comes to the closure of oil and
gas sites. Migrant workers could also lack employment security or have less protection under national
laws.
Another factor contributing to the materiality of these matters is the extensive contracting-out of oil
and gas operations. Contracting-out arrangements have relevance for the security of employment,
since workers for such operators frequently have temporary contracts.
S1: Freedom of association and collective bargaining
The oil and gas sector in many countries has a higher rate of trade union representation and collective
bargaining coverage than the economy-wide national average. However, freedom of association may
be at risk, particularly in locations where these are not guaranteed by national legislation and/or where
enforcement is weak. Many oil and gas operations are located in countries where the rule of law has
broken down (ten of the 148 countries rated in the 2022 ITUC Rights Index), where labour rights are
not guaranteed (34 countries) or where there are systematic violations of labour rights (39 countries).
Offshore operations may be particularly challenging for collective bargaining arrangements. The
proportion of self-employed workers (‘contractors’) whose working conditions are determined by a
collective bargaining agreement (the ‘collective bargaining coverage rate’) is typically lower than that
of employees.
S1: Training and skills development
Training and skills development are particularly significant in the oil and gas sector along a number
of dimensions. Oil and gas can be both technically difficult and dangerous and it is therefore
imperative that the workers are properly trained and have the skills and capabilities to handle the risks
entailed. Health and safety-related training, including the proper operation of equipment and
hazardous chemicals, is key to reduce the risk of accidents and occupational diseases.
Some oil and gas operations are placed in the middle or close to conflict-affected or high-risk areas.
They may also be the subject of controversy which leads to the necessity of security personal. Thus,
this sustainability matter also includes training of security personal in human rights and humanitarian
law.
S1: Measures against violence and harassment in the workplace
The oil and gas sector has a high proportion of male workers. The risk of sexual harassment at the
workplace is particularly high in ‘male dominated’ sectors and at remote locations.
Negative publicity on this issue can have a negative impact on the reputation of specific undertakings
as well as on the industry as a whole, and can make it more difficult to retain existing and recruit new
female workers.
Measures against violence and harassment at the workplace include clear policies on these issues,
workforce training and an effective grievance procedure.
S1: Diversity, including gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value
The required conditions, locations, skills, and types of work associated with the oil and gas sector can
be a barrier for entry, hinder employee diversity and result in discrimination. Discriminatory practices
can limit access to jobs, as well as lead to inequalities in treatment, remuneration, and benefits. Cases
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 53 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
of discrimination in the sector may include race, colour, sex, gender, disability, religion, national
extraction, and worker status. Recruitment bias and unequal pay may also create disadvantage for
local communities. The sector features significant gender imbalance, showing especially in senior
management positions. Limited parental leave, extended work arrangements, social or cultural
biases, or specific country-laws preventing women from working in hazardous or arduous occupations
may also increase the barriers to job access.
S1: Other work-related rights
The sector’s business relationships, including relations with state-owned enterprises in countries
where violations of human rights occur, may result in incidents of forced labour and modern slavery.
S1/S2: Health and safety
Many oil and gas operations are both strenuous and dangerous and are associated with high degree
of risk on a number of health and safety matters. Injuries may be caused by accidents with heavy
equipment or transport to remote areas such as offshore oil rigs. Workers’ health may be impaired by
prolonged exposure to hazardous substances. This sector has higher than average rates of fatalities,
injuries, lost workdays and occupational diseases. Worker injuries, illnesses, and fatalities can lead
to regulatory penalties, negative publicity, low worker morale and productivity, and increased
healthcare and compensation costs.
This sustainability matter covers the undertakings policies regarding health and safety, critical incident
risk management, as well as workforce health, wellbeing, and safety. Moreover, considering the
recent covid-19 pandemic, the sustainability matter also covers pandemic preparedness and the
undertaking’s response within its value chain.
The sector is characterized by the extensive use of on-site contractors for construction and
maintenance. The relationship with these contractors is typically extensive given the large capital
investments involved and the length of time these contractors will be working on-site (for example, oil
rigs may take a year or more to construct and may cost tens or even hundreds of millions of euros to
construct). The health and safety risks faced by own workforce thus extend to the workers of these
contractors (the ILO has noted that health and safety risks are particularly high for contract workers
in this sector).
S2: Working conditions
While the sector generates employment across all its value chain, its practices may also be
associated with negative impacts, such as disparities in working conditions for contract workers,
ineffective labour-management consultations and job insecurity. Outsourcing activities is common in
the industry, resulting in reduced labour costs and avoiding collective agreements. It may cause less
favourable conditions for contract workers, lower remuneration, less training, higher accident rates,
diminished job security, lack of social protection or access to the grievance mechanisms, as well as
unequal terms between different groups of workers. Lack of relevant skills, knowledge, or accessible
training programs may also restrict local communities from accessing employment opportunities
created by the sector.
S2: Diversity, including gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value
The conditions, locations, necessary skills, and types of work associated with the oil and gas sector
can be a barrier for entry, hinder employee diversity, and result in discrimination. Discriminatory
practices can impede access to jobs and career development, as well as lead to inequalities in
treatment, remuneration, and benefits. Documented cases of discrimination in the oil and gas sector
concern race, colour, sex, gender, disability, religion, national extraction, and worker status. The
sector's widespread use of contract workers, often with differing terms of employment, can also be
conducive to discrimination.
S2: Other work-related rights
The sector is exposed to risks of violations of human rights and other ways of exploitation in its supply
chain, which may include organizations that operate in the countries with low rates of enforcement of
human rights. Activities at risk can include work at oil fields and offshore platforms, such as in catering,
cleaning, construction, maintenance and waste management, as well as in marine and land
transportation activities. Operations aboard ships registered in countries other than the country of the
ship’s beneficial owner may create increased risks of human rights violations linked to external
crewing companies and obscured accountability. Offshore work may bring risk of forced labour due
to isolated locations and challenges in enforcing appropriate measures. Selection of suppliers using
social criteria is essential to mitigate negative impacts.
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 54 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
S3: Communities’ economic, social and cultural rights
The sector positive impacts may include investment and income for local communities, local
employment and procurement, community education and training, leading to increased purchasing
power and local business development. Depending on the organization practices, the industry can
also cause negative impacts related to potential economic disparities, increased dependence of local
suppliers and vulnerability of local groups. For example, an influx of external workers may increase
pressure on housing, infrastructure and public services. Local communities may also need to cope
with environmental legacy costs of sector activities. The transition to a low-carbon economy is
expected to decrease the activity in the oil and gas, making communities that depend on the sector
more vulnerable to the resulting economic downturn. Local communities may also be affected by
land acquisitions, which can lead to a loss of livelihood. Oil and gas activities can sometimes result
in the displacement of other land users, restricting their access to resources and involuntary
resettlement of local communities. This resettlement can lead to physical and economic
displacement, impacting local communities’ livelihoods and human rights.
S3: Communities’ civil and political rights
Oil and gas activities may trigger local conflict or intensify existing ones, especially in the areas
characterized by social and political instability. Possible causes to conflicts may include negative
environmental impacts, inadequate engagement of stakeholders and indigenous people in decision-
making, uneven or disproportionate distribution of economic benefits or disputes over the use of land
and natural resources. Such conflict can heighten the need to engage security personnel, increasing
the risks for violations of human rights, such as the rights to freedom of association and freedom of
speech, as well as lead to violence, injuries, or deaths. Organizations in the sector have responsibility
to ensure security practices consistent with protection of human rights and facilitating communication
to address the sources of conflict.
S3: Particular rights of indigenous communities, including free, prior and informed consent;
self-determination; and cultural rights
Sector’s proximity to communities can present economic opportunities and benefits for indigenous
peoples through employment, training, and community development programs. However, it can also
disrupt indigenous peoples’ cultural, spiritual, and economic ties to their lands or natural
environments, on which they may be dependent. Sector’s activities may risk compromising
indigenous peoples’ social cohesion, rights, safety and well-being, cause displacement or limit access
to water for those communities. Some negative impacts may affect indigenous women more severely
than men. Indigenous peoples have often a special legal status and before initiating development on
lands or resources that indigenous peoples use or own, organizations are expected to seek free,
prior, and informed consent (FPIC).
S4: Information-related impacts for consumers and/or end-users
The undertakings in the sector have unique access to information channels and mainstream media
which are shaping narratives around sustainability matters. Oil and gas companies are also facing
significant pressure from stakeholders to provide transparent and comprehensive information on their
environmental and social performance. In the past, the sector has faced multiple controversies around
information practices and the alignment of its corporate communication with globally established
climate and social targets remains an important sustainability matter.
S4: Personal safety of consumers and/or end-users
Consumer safety is an important part of the safety management within the retail part of the sector.
The retail sale of automotive fuel is typically realised under multiple safeguards that prevent potential
threats of fires at the gas pumps and allow safe dispensing and handling of fuels. Undertakings in the
sector need to identify and manage any actual and potential impacts on the personal safety of
consumers, implementing policies related to keeping safe from fire and explosion hazards, emissions
of carbon monoxide, safe storage and disposal of fuels, but also theft, violence or slip and fall
accidents.
S4: Social inclusion of consumers and/or end-users
Consumers are at the centre of the EU energy policy and there is a wide range of EU actions and
measures aim at protecting and empowering energy consumers. Access to energy at affordable
prices has been and is a priority of the EU with a number of government actions, including direct
subsidies to consumers, being taken to ensure stable petrol prices during the energy crisis in Europe.
EFRAG SRB, 17 September 2024 Page 55 of 56
[Draft] ESRS Oil and Gas
G1: Business conduct
Given the wide sustainability impacts of oil and gas sector, as well as its dynamics and complexity, a
system of shared values and norms are essential to provide a clear expectation on behaviours for
stakeholders across the whole value chain. The corporate culture is essential to manage the risks
related to governance and it typically envelops code of conduct and ethics within the organization,
policies related to dialogue with stakeholders, as well as the governance bodies influencing
organization.
G1: Political engagement and lobbying activities
The oil and gas sector can exert significant influence on government policies and is among the sectors
with the largest lobbying expenditures. In regions where activities generate significant revenues,
organizations in the sector may obtain better representation amongst government representatives
and increased power over public policy decisions. Strong political influence creates risks of disruption
to the policies and regulations, unequal distribution of governmental subsidies or setting commodity
prices that do not reflect the full costs of products. Monitoring and management of political
engagement of the sector is essential for effective allocation of national resources towards the low-
carbon economy transition, sustainable development and decreasing dependence on the fossil fuels.
G1: Management of relationships with suppliers including payment practices
Organizations in the oil and gas sector deal with many complex financial transactions, including
payments to suppliers and governments. The fair behaviour with suppliers is essential to avoid supply
chain disruption, especially in context of dealing with small and medium enterprises, which can be
particularly vulnerable to late payments. Transparency of payments to governments, reporting
country-level and project-level payments can also help distinguish the economic importance of the oil
and gas sector to countries, enable public debate, and inform government decision-making. It can
also enable governments to address tax avoidance and evasion, correct information asymmetry and
level the playing field for governments when negotiating contracts.
G1: Corruption and bribery
Corruption in the oil and gas sector can occur throughout the value chain and has been linked to
various negative impacts, such as misallocation of resources revenues, damage to the environment,
abuse of democracy and human rights, and political instability. Due to its characteristics of interactions
and complexity of financial transactions, the oil and gas sector faces higher risks of corruption in
comparison with other sectors. To combat corruption and prevent the negative impacts that stem from
it, organizations in the oil and gas sector are expected by the marketplace, international norms, and
stakeholders to demonstrate their adherence to integrity, governance, and responsible business
practices. Responsible business conduct of the sector also includes the anti-competitive behaviour
practices as well as beneficial ownership.
G1: Cyber security
Cyber security addresses security in “cyber space”. Oil and gas sector encompasses high critical
infrastructure and has also embraced new technologies in the various aspects of their activities in the
past few years. The industry widely uses digital control systems, such as SCADA, to automate the
industrial, physical processes taking place in exploration facilities, refineries and oil and gas pipelines.
The systems are used to automating, controlling and monitoring equipment such as valves, pumps
or centrifuges.
This digital transformation goes hand in hand with an increased reliance on trustworthy and stable
information and network systems. However, this evolution amplifies the vulnerability and exposure to
cyber threats. Cyberattacks can cause serious damage to the undertaking’s assets, impair property
and divulge sensitive information. Moreover, they can disrupt operations, services to clients and
supply chain interactions. All this might lead to financial costs and losses as well as adverse impact
on people and environment
