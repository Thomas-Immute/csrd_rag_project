EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
Summary in seven key points
This implementation guidance covers the upstream and downstream value chain (VC) of the
undertaking and not its own operations; it should be read with IG 1 Materiality Assessment.
1. The undertaking’s sustainability statement shall include information about all material
impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) including those that arise or may arise in the
context of its business relationships in the upstream and downstream value chain.
Business relationships are not limited to direct contractual relationships.
2. The undertaking is not required to include value chain information in all disclosures,
but only when it is connected to material IROs beyond its own operations, due to its
business relationships, and when specifically required by the disclosure requirement.
3. Therefore, the materiality assessment shall cover the identification of material IROs in
the VC, with a focus on where (geographies, activities/sectors, operations, suppliers,
customers, other relationships, etc.) in the VC they are likely to materialise. Key
disclosures about the undertaking’s materiality assessment are SBM-1, SBM-3 and IRO-
1 (ESRS 2). They are not limited to but should cover the assessment of IROs in the VC.
4. Topical standards require disclosures about policies, targets and actions (PATs) for
material matters. In particular, they require either the disclosure of such PATs or a
statement about their absence. Limited to the extent that those policies, actions and
targets involve actors in the value chain, when describing the PATs for material matters,
the disclosure shall include information about how these address material upstream
and/or downstream VC IROs.
5. Topical standards require to include VC data only for a few metrics. However, when
the undertaking considers that a material IRO in the VC is not sufficiently covered by
the requirements in ESRS, it shall include additional entity-specific disclosures,
including metrics on when such information is necessary in order to enable users to
understand the undertaking’s material impacts, risks or opportunities.
6. When, after making reasonable efforts, it cannot collect primary VC information from
actors in its value chain for the materiality assessment or in order to prepare its
disclosures of material IROs, the undertaking shall estimate the missing information.
When estimating the missing information, it shall use all reasonable and supportable
information available without undue cost and effort, including proxies and sector data
and other information from indirect sources. The undertaking shall describe in the
basis for preparation for the metrics reported using value chain estimation and the
resulting level of accuracy. Depending on the circumstances, the materiality
assessment may be validly conducted without primary information being collected
from actors in the value chain.
7. The inclusion of VC information in the sustainability statement does not affect the
reporting boundaries, which correspond to the boundaries of the entities included in
the perimeter of its consolidated financial statements. The inclusion of VC information
correspond to the extent to which the sustainability statement covers the relationships
that all the undertakings in the consolidation perimeter have with their respective VC
counterparts, including beyond the first tier. Associates and other investees which are
not consolidated in the financial statements are treated as the other business
relationships, i.e., as actors in the value chain when this is the case. Refer also to
Chapter 2.3 below on operational control which is relevant to ESRS E1 Climate change,
ESRS E2 Pollution and ESRS E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems.

EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
1. Introduction
8. The objective of this guidance is to support the implementation activities of preparers
and others using or analysing ESRS reports, specifically on value chain information, in
accordance with the requirements of Articles 19a or 29a of the Directive 2013/34/EU
(referred to as the ‘Accounting Directive’) as amended following the Directive (EU)
2022/2464, as regards Corporate Sustainability Reporting (referred to as ‘the CSRD’).
9. The content of this document has been developed on the basis of the Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 2023, supplementing Directive
2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards sustainability
reporting standards.
10. In its implementation supporting function, EFRAG cannot develop concepts and
reporting requirements that go
beyond the content of the July A note on Corporate Sustainability Due

Structure of the guidance
12. The document is organised in three chapters as follows.
(a) The next chapter covers how to navigate VC requirements in ESRS, which is the
basis for the rest of the document.
(b) The chapter following it covers how an undertaking may implement VC under ESRS
by using frequently asked questions with the aim of providing practical guidance.
May 2024 Page 6 of 48

(c) The last chapter includes the VC coverage map for Set 1 ESRS explaining the
coverage of the upstream and downstream VC as required by ESRS (excluding
considerations of entity-specific disclosures and SFDR indicators).
Cross references to IG 1
13. To avoid duplication and reduce the length of this document, there is significant
reference to the Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance (IG 1) developed
by EFRAG. For example, the due diligence aspects related to the materiality
assessment (and VC aspects) are covered in that guidance rather than here.

2. Navigating value chain under CSRD and ESRS
16. CSRD Art 19(a)(3) and 29(a)(3) require that reported information relates to an
undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream VC, including its
products and services, its business relationships and its supply chain.
17. ESRS have been developed according to this legal requirement. The CSRD does not
provide any additional definitions or guidance on VC. However, with reference to
May 2024 Page 7 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
impacts, the CSRD refers to international instruments of sustainability due diligence
which specify how the undertakings are expected to identify, address and report on
impacts across their VC.
18. The definitions of ‘value chain’, ‘actors in the value chain’ and ‘business relationships’
are defined in Annex 2 of the July 2023 Delegated Act.
19. Not all Disclosure Requirements (DRs) and datapoints in sector agnostic ESRS require
the inclusion of information about the undertaking’s upstream and downstream VC. In
many cases the undertaking is expected to focus on its own operations.
General requirements
20. The general requirements relating to all disclosures on VC can be found in ESRS 1
General requirements:
(a) the general requirements for reporting on VC are in chapter 5;
(b) Application Requirements AR 17 set out guidance on ‘Estimation using sector
averages and proxies’;
(c) ESRS 1 requires the inclusion of material VC information when this is necessary to
allow users to understand the undertaking’s material IROs and to produce
information that meets the qualitative characteristics of information stipulated in
Appendix C of ESRS 1 (ESRS 1 paragraph 65). This is a principles-based approach
that works on top of the specific datapoints in ESRS that require to include specific
VC information. This means that where necessary (i.e. reflecting the outcome of the
materiality assessment), the undertaking shall cover the VC; and
(d) lastly, but importantly, ESRS 1 contains specific transitional provisions with respect
to VC in Chapter 10.2.
Detailed requirements
21. Other detailed requirements about value chain can be found in ESRS as follows.
(a) ESRS requires disclosures concerning the process and outcomes of the materiality
assessment which are covered in ESRS 2 General disclosures (IRO-1 and SBM-3),
accompanied by SBM-1. For more on this, see below FAQ 4 How should
information about the VC be disclosed in the context of the MA as well as rows 1
through 3 of the VC coverage map of ESRS. For details about the materiality
assessment process, please refer to IG 1 and for the related VC aspects, please see
below FAQ 3 How should the MA process be organised to properly capture
material IROs in the VC. Please also refer to IG 1 FAQ 10 Should the assessment of
IROs rely on quantitative information?
(b) All topical standards require undertakings to
disclose their policies, actions and targets for Alignment with the ISSB and
material IROs. To the extent that such policies, GRI
actions and targets address material IROs in the The definitions of value chain

of the VC for Policies, Actions or Targets). Within the disclosures about policies,
actions and targets, the Social topical standards ESRS S2 Workers in the value
chain, ESRS S3 Affected communities and ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users
provide a framework for reporting on material IROs related to these groups of
people in the VC and their management. As a reminder, the undertaking can
comply by disclosing that it has not adopted policies, actions and targets with
reference to the relevant material sustainability matter and provide reasons for this.
It may also report a timeframe in which it aims to adopt them (ESRS 2 paragraphs
62 and 72). Please refer to rows 4 and 5 of the VC coverage map of ESRS.
(c) There are only few sector-agnostic metrics in topical ESRS that require VC
information (see Chapter 2.6 Coverage of the VC for metrics). ESRS S2 to S4 for
instance do not include metrics per se. The other metrics do not refer to the value
chain. However, this includes some information about procured materials, please
refer to rows 6 and 7 of the VC coverage map of ESRS.

Value chain coverage map
22. Chapter 4 of this document presents the VC coverage map illustrating the type of
coverage of VC information that is required by each specific Disclosure Requirement
in sector-agnostic ESRS. This also includes which metrics require inclusion of VC data
in the actual calculation.
May 2024 Page 9 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
2.1 What is the VC?
23. While the focus of this Implementation Guidance is on upstream and downstream VC,
the definition of value chain in Annex 2 of the Delegated Act is broader than the
upstream and downstream VC, as it also includes own operations. VC is defined as ‘the
full range of activities, resources and relationships related to the undertaking’s
business model and the external environment in which it operates. A value chain
encompasses the activities, resources and relationships the undertaking uses and
relies on to create its products or services from conception to delivery, consumption
and end-of-life. Relevant activities, resources and relationships include: related to the
undertaking’s business model and the external environment in which it operates. A
value chain encompasses the activities, resources and relationships the undertaking
uses and relies on to create its products or services from conception to delivery,
consumption and end-of-life. Relevant activities, resources and relationships include:
(a) those in the undertaking’s own operations, such as human resources;
(b) those along its supply, marketing and distribution channels, such as materials and
service sourcing and product and service sale and delivery; and
(c) the financing, geographical, geopolitical and regulatory environments in which the
undertaking operates.’
24. ESRS use the term ‘value chain’ in the singular, although it is recognised that
undertakings may have multiple value chains.
25. According to this definition, the VC issues addressed in this implementation guidance
include both upstream and downstream actors and their activities. Actors or
undertakings upstream from the reporting undertaking (e.g., suppliers) provide
products or services that are used in the development of the undertaking’s own
products or services. Actors downstream from the reporting undertaking (e.g.,
distributors, customers, waste management) receive or use products or services of the
reporting undertaking or waste stream by the customers or end-users.
26. Annex 2 defines ‘business relationships’ as ‘The relationships the undertaking has with
business partners, entities in its value chain, and any other non-State or State entity
directly linked to its business operations, products or services. Business relationships
are not limited to direct contractual relationships. They include indirect business
relationships in the undertaking’s value chain beyond the first tier, and shareholding
positions in joint ventures or investments. ’as ‘[t]he relationships the undertaking has
with business partners, entities in its value chain, and any other non-State or State entity
directly linked to its business operations, products or services. Business relationships
are not limited to direct contractual relationships. They include indirect business
relationships in the undertaking’s value chain beyond the first tier, and shareholding
positions in joint ventures or investments.’
27. Setting out the VC activities may help identify the VC actors1.
1 EFRAG has consulted from 21 January to 21 May 2024 on an Exposure Draft of ESRS for listed SMEs
(LSME ED). Differently from the sector-agnostic standards that support the preparation of consolidated
sustainability statement for the group, consistent with the CSRD, LSME ED has been developed to
support the preparation of the individual (i.e., not consolidated) sustainability statement. In the LSME
ED material IROs of the subsidiaries are included in the sustainability statement as IROs arising from the
parent’s business relationship with them, i.e., as part of the value chain.
May 2024 Page 10 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
Should IROs linked to all actors in the VC be considered?
28. ESRS do not require information on each and every actor in the VC, but rather the
inclusion of material VC information, i.e., when material IROs arise in the VC (ESRS 1
paragraph 64). When assessing material IROs, all relevant actors (both in direct and
indirect relationships) are to be considered. However, the assessment should focus on
relationships that are likely to be associated with material IROs, for example
relationships with:
(a) those actors who are associated with ‘hot spots’ and who likely expose to the
likelihood of actual and potential impacts (therefore generating impacts on people
and/or environment, which can in turn be sources of risks and opportunities); or
(b) those actors with respect to whom the business model of the undertaking shows
key dependencies in terms of products or services (therefore generating risks and
opportunities for the undertaking).
How does leverage or influence over the VC impact reporting?
29. In some cases, an undertaking may have leverage or be able to exert influence over
actors in its VC. Examples include cases where the undertaking is a large supplier or
customer and thereby exerts influence on its business relationships to manage its
impacts.
30. In other cases, its ability to obtain the necessary VC information as well as its capacity
to contribute to or influence the management of IROs arising in the VC, may be limited
given the nature or the absence of direct contractual arrangements, the level of control
that it exercises on the operations outside the consolidation scope and its buying
power. Other factors may include customs in the industry, the behaviour of the
reporting entity's competitors, and the willingness or ability of suppliers and customers
to provide such information.
31. However, leverage is not a factor when it comes to determining whether IROs that arise
in the VC are material or not. Leverage may affect the ability of the company to obtain
data and/or information from its counterparties in the VC. This may be relevant for the
reporting of material impacts as well as for reporting metrics, including entity-specific
information (See ESRS 1 AR 1 to AR 5) and may lead the undertaking to use estimates
and proxies.
2.2 Why does VC matter?
32. The CSRD and ESRS require that the sustainability statement include material
information about the upstream and downstream VC.
33. The reason for this is that the impacts, risks and/or opportunities deriving from impacts
or dependencies, of a reporting undertaking often occur in its upstream or
downstream VC rather than in its own operations. Therefore, focusing on own
operations would provide only a partial picture of the impacts on people and the
environment connected to the undertaking’s activities, products and services.
Furthermore, this would not allow for an appropriate identification of risks and
opportunities. Consider the following examples.
May 2024 Page 11 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
(a) A EU garment and apparel company sells basic T-shirts produced in a country
outside the EU by an external supplier and reports under ESRS. The company may
pay its employees an adequate wage under collective bargaining agreements for
its operations in the EU. However, assuming that the external supplier is based in a
country outside the EU where the remuneration paid to the supplier’s employees
is below the adequate wage benchmark for the country and freedom of association
in that country may not be allowed, the reporting undertaking would not provide
a relevant depiction of its impacts if it was to consider only its own employees when
determining the scope of its actual and potential material negative impacts. In
other terms, material impacts on working conditions may be identified within the
workforce in its upstream VC (for this particular supplier).
(b) With a supplier of wood, a European retailer makes toys in a factory outside the
EU, where legal requirements are less stringent. The toy-making process has
several environmental and health and safety risks, due to dust and chemicals. There
is therefore a significant risk that the workers and the local communities are
exposed to severe occupational hazard exposures and health risks – important
when considering impact materiality. From a financial materiality perspective, if the
officials in that location start upholding laws rather than accepting bribes as is
currently the case, it could result in significant fines, possibly even closure for the
manufacturer. This could have a direct and significant financial impact on the
European retailer.
(c) An electronics producer may have processes in place to control and minimise the
packaging and other waste from its own operations, but its products may create
electronic waste which may in turn be hazardous to animals and wildlife when
discarded. This aspect is connected to the undertaking’s downstream value chain,
i.e. to impacts deriving from the end use of its products.
(d) As highlighted by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Scope 3 GHG emissions are
expected to be material for many or most undertakings.
2.3 From own operations to value chain
The reporting group as a starting point
34. ESRS 1 paragraph 62 states: ‘The sustainability statement shall be for the same
reporting undertaking as the financial statements.’ In the Accounting Directive, a
group is defined as ‘a parent undertaking and all its subsidiary undertakings’. As this is
derived from financial reporting, sustainability professionals should obtain assistance
from the financial reporting function to understand the implications that this has for
the ESRS sustainability statement.
35. Sometimes subsidiaries are not included in the financial reporting consolidation on
the basis of materiality, for practical reasons. Such subsidiaries may still have material
sustainability matters that need to be reported in the consolidated sustainability
statement. Therefore, the materiality of their IROs need to be evaluated as well. Please
refer to IG 1 Chapter 5.2 FAQs on financial materiality for insights into these for the
purpose of the sustainability statement.
Internal or intragroup transactions
36. For sustainability reporting purposes, groups must include information about material
IROs of the subsidiaries. The elimination of internal transactions in the preparation of
May 2024 Page 12 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
consolidated financial statements has no implications for the identification of IROs. The
underlying impacts that occur in the group’s operations are in scope of the reporting,
when material, as well as the ones identified in the VC. For example, the impacts from
the emissions from transport, even if not for external sales, do not disappear merely
because they relate to an internal/intragroup transaction. Therefore, groups should
consider IROs related to internal transactions where appropriate.
Joint arrangements
37. For undertakings that apply IFRS, effective since 2013, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
changed the financial reporting treatment under IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures as
follows:
38. This means that rather than proportional consolidation, for joint operations, a joint
operator with joint control will recognise in relation to its interest in a joint operation:
(a) its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;
(b) its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;
(c) its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint
operation;
(d) its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and
(e) its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.
39. This means that its assets and liabilities forming part of the financial perimeter are own
operations rather than value chain.
Operational control
40. For certain environmental matters, ESRS refer to the concept of ‘operational control’
to identify situations where information about IROs of a site, an asset or an entity under
operational control but outside the financial control perimeter have to be reported.
May 2024 Page 13 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
Operational control – definition
41. In alignment with the GHG Protocol, ESRS include the concept of operational control,
which is defined in Annex 2 of the Delegated Act as the situation where ‘the
undertaking has the ability to direct the operational activities and relationships of the
entity, site, operation or asset’. The GHG Protocol adds that this is where the
undertaking has the full authority to introduce and implement the operating policies,
which often implies also executing such operations.
42. AR 40 of ESRS E1 also explains, in the context of GHG emissions, that this happens
‘when the undertaking holds the license - or permit - to operate the assets from these
associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment entities) and
contractual arrangements.’
43. Operational control may also apply where the undertaking is legally recognised under
certain regulations (for example the EU Emissions Trading system) as an ‘operator’2 of
a facility. This implies specific legal rights and obligations.
44. The GHG Protocol (page 18) also emphasises that operational control does not mean
that an undertaking necessarily has authority to make all the decisions concerning an
operation. For example, large capital investments may require approval of all partners
that have joint financial control. Not having the authority to make all decisions
concerning an operation does not affect the determination of operational control.
45. There is no definition of ‘operations’ in the CSRD or the ESRS. On Page 23 of the GHG
Protocol reads, as follows: ‘The term “operations” is used here as a generic term to
denote any kind of business activity, irrespective of its organizational, governance, or
legal structures.’
46. Assessing whether operational control exists depends on the undertaking’s specific
facts and circumstances, including the sector(s) where it operates, and on the types of
contractual relationships prevailing in that sector(s).
Operational control – ESRS E1, GHG emissions
47. Under ESRS E1, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions shall include, in addition to the
emissions of the parent and its subsidiaries, also the GHG emissions of sites, assets and
entities under operational control, as a separate line item.
48. Supplementing the definition in Annex 2 of the Delegated Act, ESRS E1 paragraph 46
focusses on the treatment of entities related to the reporting group (such as associates,
joint ventures and joint arrangements not structured through an entity) under
operational control. The treatment means that the reporting is accountable for 100%
of the relevant emissions rather than the relevant equity holding.
2 As explained in the GHG Protocol on page 21: ‘Since compliance responsibility generally falls to the operator
(not equity holders or the group company that has financial control), governments will usually require reporting on
the basis of operational control, either through a facility level-based system or involving the consolidation of data
within certain geographical boundaries (e.g. the EU ETS will allocate emission permits to the operators of certain
installations).’
May 2024 Page 14 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
49. ESRS E1 AR 40 clarifies the definition in Annex 2 whereby the undertaking shall include
100% of the GHG emissions of the entities it operationally controls in its disclosures. It
provides an example whereby, when an undertaking has a contractually defined part-
time operational control, it shall consolidate
100% the GHG emissions emitted during the

be clear about the scope of the target(s).
51. ESRS E1 (paragraph 50 (b)) requires disclosing
the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of undertakings
under operational control separately from the ones related to the consolidated group
(presented following ESRS E1 paragraph 50 (a)). The latter correspond to the outcome
of the financial control approach in the GHG Protocol. Please note that a literal reading
of paragraph 50(b) may make it seem as if this is only applicable to investees
(associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated subsidiaries, etc.) under
operational control but this is not the intention. GHG emissions of entities, assets and
sites under operational control but without financial control (or without investment
relationship) will also be included in the disclosure under paragraph 50(b).
Furthermore, for IFRS preparers, any assets, including the undertaking’s share of any
assets held jointly in joint operations (defined in IFRS11) or its liabilities, including its
share of any liabilities incurred jointly in joint operations (defined in IFRS 11) will be
part of the balance sheet for financial reporting purposes, i.e., included in disclosures
under paragraph 50(a). In addition, where the reporting undertaking has operational
control over its joint operators’ (defined in IFRS 11) assets, the GHG emissions arising
from this will be included in scope 1 and 2 under ESRS E1 paragraph 50(b).
Operational control – Other environmental standards
52. ESRS E2-4 Pollution of air, water and soil also specifically includes those emissions from
facilities under the operational control of the undertaking. Similarly, ESRS E4
Biodiversity and ecosystems in paragraph 16(a) also includes sites under the
operational control of the undertaking.
Operational control – ESRS 2, Basis for preparation
53. ESRS 2 BP 1 (paragraph 5) requires that the undertaking discloses to what extent the
sustainability statement covers the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value
chain. When appropriate, the undertaking should describe whether operational
control was considered or not.
May 2024 Page 15 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
Compatibility of ESRS E1 and the GHG Protocol
54. As described in paragraph 34 above, ESRS use a financial control approach while the
GHG Protocol allows for three possible reporting approaches. The disclosure of scope
1 and 2 under ESRS E1 paragraph 50(a) is aligned with the financial control approach
under the GHG Protocol. However, in order to provide further information, ESRS
requires separate disclosures about the emissions from items under operational
control (ESRS E1 paragraph 50(b)).
55. The intention of this step was to reduce the options under the GHG Protocol and to
thus improve comparability, while maintaining compatibility with the GHG Protocol, at
level of ESRS E1 paragraph 50 (a). The requirement to disclose emissions separately
from items that are not financially controlled but that are under the operational control
of the reporting undertaking provides a full picture of the impacts of the undertaking.
This additional disclosure requirement also recognises that the environmental
regulations often apply to the operator rather than the owner of assets.
56. ESRS E1 does not aim at requiring the full implementation of the operational control
approach under the GHG Protocol, as it maintains financial control as the primary
selected approach.
57. An undertaking is able to reconcile ESRS reporting with that under a GHG Protocol
operational control approach, by deducting the GHG emissions from those assets,
sites etc., that are under financial but not operational control from its total Scope 1 and
2 emissions under ESRS E1.

Operational control does not apply to Social standards
60. Definitions used in ESRS S1 Own workforce and S2 Workers in the value chain focus on
the contractual arrangements between the workers and the undertaking. Similarly, the
basis for ESRS S3 Affected communities and S4 Consumers and end-users is the
relationship of these stakeholders with the reporting entity.
61. Operational control is not relevant to these standards.
Including value chain information
62. The information about material IROs of the parent and subsidiaries is ‘extended’ in
order to cover VC information. This is defined in ESRS 1 paragraph 63 as information
on the material IROs connected to the undertaking through its direct and indirect
business relationships in the upstream and/or downstream value chain. This may
include associates and joint arrangements where they are also actors in the value chain
of the reporting undertaking, such as when they are customers or suppliers as
described below.
63. Value chain information is part of the sustainability statement in the following three
aspects:
(a) the materiality assessment – please refer to Chapter 3 FAQ 3 How should the MA
process be organised to properly capture material IROs in the VC?
(b) the description of whether (and if so, the extent to which) the reporting
undertaking’s policies, actions and targets cover its VC - please refer to Chapter
2.5 Coverage of the VC for PAT.
(c) metrics related to the VC - please refer to Chapter 2.6 Coverage of the VC for

66. Where associates and joint ventures do not form part of the value chain as suppliers or
customers (also referred to as actors in the value chain), they are treated as
investments. Investments form part of the undertaking’s business relationships (as
defined). As such, they may give rise to impacts that are connected to the undertaking
and that are to be considered in the materiality assessment and reported when
material. However, topical ESRS do not have specific reporting requirements that
indicate how to measure these impacts, apart from GHG Scope 3 Category 15

explained in AR 46 and AR 48.

how to measure impacts that are connected to the undertaking through its investments
without joint control and/or significant influence, meaning generally below 20%, apart
from GHG Scope 3 Category 15 disclosures as explained in paragraph 66.
3 This is not the case when operational control applies.
May 2024 Page 19 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
Entity-specific disclosures
68. As explained in paragraph 69 below, in the cases above, apart from the materiality
assessment process, the undertaking may also have to provide entity-specific
information, i.e. more than the specified requirements in ESRS relating to the VC.
2.4 Which IROs in the VC are to be disclosed?
69. The two overarching requirements in ESRS 1 that are applicable here are:
(a) paragraph 63 requiring information on material IROs connected to the
undertaking’s upstream and downstream VC; and
(b) paragraph 11 requiring entity-specific information when a reporting undertaking
concludes that a material IRO is not covered sufficiently by an ESRS, to enable users
to understand such IRO. Such entity-specific information is expected to cover both
IROs in own operations and IROs in the upstream and downstream VC, when they
are material.
70. An impact may be material to the reporting undertaking if it arises in any part of the
VC, including at any tier of its upstream VC or supply chain. In this regard, in the IRO
assessment in the VC, the undertaking has to consider IROs that it may be connected
to through its own operations, products or services via business relationships (see also
IG 1 FAQ 2 What is meant by the undertaking being “connected” with an impact?).
71. The identification of IROs in the upstream and downstream VC is embedded in the
materiality assessment (ESRS 1, Chapter 3 – Double materiality) as the basis for
sustainability disclosure. For further information about materiality, please consult IG 1.
2.5 Coverage of the VC for Policies, Actions and/or Targets
(PATs)
72. To the extent that the undertaking has PAT in place that address VC actors, for material
IROs (including those in the VC), it should disclose this (ESRS 2 paragraphs 64(b), 67(b)
and 70(b)). Examples could include:
(a) policies to prevent and control pollution by its VC actors;
(b) policies against bribery and corruption for VC actors and training for them;
(c) actions and resources related to pollution as well as targets to reduce pollution
generated by a supplier (ESRS E2 Pollution AR 13 and 19);
(d) clauses regarding the respect of fundamental human rights in contracts with VC
actors;
(e) audits conducted on high-risk suppliers;
(f) selection criteria for new suppliers such as the existence of effective grievance
mechanisms or freedom of association; and
(g) targets for suppliers on sustainable material use for example X% recycled content
or X% less waste.
73. VC information coverage is also important for ESRS E1-1 paragraph 16(b), which
requires disclosing the decarbonisation levers identified by the undertaking in setting
its targets and defining its actions, including levers in the VC. This type of information
May 2024 Page 20 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
is expected to be primarily needed in order to set and manage the targets and
implement the actions. Reporting is expected to use data existing for such purposes.
74. As a reminder, the undertaking can comply by disclosing that it has not adopted
policies and/or actions with reference to the relevant sustainability matter and provide
reasons for this. It may also report a timeframe in which it aims to adopt them (ESRS 2
paragraph 62). The same applies to targets (ESRS 2 paragraph 72).
75. In addition, the undertaking should always consider the need to provide entity-specific
information. Please refer to paragraph 69 (b) above.
76. In ESRS 4 Biodiversity and ecosystems, there are specific requirements dealing with
value chain information: ESRS 4-1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and
ecosystems in strategy and business model, the topical specification ESRS 2 IRO-1
Description of processes to identify and assess material biodiversity and ecosystem-
related impacts, risks, dependencies and opportunities as well as ESRS E4-4 Targets
related to biodiversity and ecosystems (paragraph 32(c)). These do not necessarily
result in the need to collect VC data from actors in the VC solely for the purpose of
reporting. The undertaking is expected to leverage on information that is collected for
business purposes, e.g., E4-1 paragraph 13, E4 ESRS 2 IRO 1 paragraph 17(a), and E4-
4 paragraph 32(c).
2.6 Coverage of the VC for Metrics Disclosure Requirements
77. All ESRS DRs related to metrics cover only own operations except for:
(a) Disclosure Requirement ESRS E1-6 Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions;
(b) Disclosure Requirement ESRS E1-7 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects
financed through carbon credits; and
(c) entity-specific disclosures where the undertaking determines whether and, if so,
what VC information is required (see paragraph 79 below).
78. As described in the VC coverage map in Chapter 4 below, there may be qualitative
disclosures required under ESRS. A few examples are listed below:
(a) Disclosure Requirement ESRS E5-4 Resource inflows requires a description of
resource inflows where material which may include a description of the IROs in the
value chain (ESRS E5 paragraph 30). However, when disclosing the quantification
of materials used in the production of the undertaking’s products and services, this
relates only to own operations (ESRS E5 paragraph 31). The undertaking
determines whether additional information on the VC is needed on an entity-
specific basis.
(b) ESRS E5-4 paragraph 30 requires a qualitative description of the undertaking’s
resource inflows along the upstream value chain. ESRS E2-5 and ESRS E5-5 refer to
materials procured and used within the undertaking. While they do not explicitly
refer to value chain information, the impacts that arise from the upstream value
chain are indirectly covered by the description of the procured material.

entity-specific metrics, as explained below.
79. Beyond the specific provisions on metrics in the sector-agnostic ESRS, the undertaking
shall provide additional VC metrics information or integrate VC data into its metrics,
when according to the outcome of its materiality assessment, this is necessary from an
entity-specific perspective (ESRS 1 paragraph 11 and AR 1 to 5 read in conjunction
with ESRS 1 paragraph 65). In particular, ESRS require the undertaking to consider
appropriate entity-specific metrics needed for understanding of the impacts or
tracking the effectiveness of companies’ actions. Possible examples are the following:
(a) impact data of suppliers should be included in the reported metrics, when the
undertaking depends in its upstream VC or supply chain on activities that have a
high impact on the environment;
(b) the percentage of workers in value chains in high-risk areas covered by social
security schemes; and
(c) the percentage reduction in health and safety incidents compared to incidents in
the prior period or as compared to a base period where the quality of the
information can be assured.
80. It is important to note that this is relevant only for those activities of VC actors that are
associated with material IROs and not for all VC actors. Also, these disclosures are not
standardised, and the selection of the appropriate metric is in the purview of the
reporting undertaking while considering the needs of users and the qualitative
characteristics of information.
81. Sector-specific ESRS will cover the inclusion of VC data in the undertaking’s impact
metrics when relevant. In the transition period until the ESRS sector standards are
available, the undertaking as part of its entity-specific disclosures shall consider this
aspect and draw inspiration from the available best reporting practices (see ESRS 1
paragraph 131(b)).
2.7 How do the transitional requirements work?
82. The general transitional provisions in ESRS 1 from paragraph 130 onwards allow for a
temporary limit for the information on the VC to be reported during the first three years
of reporting under ESRS. Specifically, preparers are required to consider VC in their
materiality assessment, but the data gathering aspects, both for qualitative and
quantitative information, are limited in their first three years of reporting.
83. The transitional provisions are intended to provide reporting undertakings with more
time to prepare for the new reporting regime in case that not all the necessary
information regarding VC is available. The transitional requirements are optional, i.e.,
the undertaking can decide whether it wants to use them or not and they apply
regardless of whether the VC actor is an SME.
May 2024 Page 22 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
84. The steps an undertaking can consider during this time may include:
(a) updating contracts with actors in the VC to reflect the status of new implemented
policies or target tracking, such as foreseeing the provision of periodic information;
(b) Stakeholder engagement and other enhancements to the materiality assessment;
(c) preparing technological infrastructure as well as other types of infrastructure
required for reporting; and
(d) improving knowledge about the structure of the VC, specific actors involved and
associated impacts and dependencies.
85. The transitional requirements (ESRS 1 paragraph 132) foresee that if not all the
necessary VC information is available during the first three years of the reporting
undertaking’s sustainability reporting under ESRS, the undertaking shall explain:
(a) the efforts it made to obtain the necessary information;
(b) the reason(s) why it could not obtain the necessary information; and
(c) its plans to obtain the necessary information in the future.
86. In addition, during the transitional period, reporting undertakings may limit
information to in-house data (such as data available to the undertaking and publicly
available information) to disclose information on policies, actions and targets for the
VC (ESRS 1 paragraph 133 (a)).
87. In addition, with reference to metrics, the undertaking is not required to include
upstream and downstream VC information, except for datapoints derived from other
EU legislation, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B (see ESRS 1 paragraph 133 b)) during
the transitional period.
88. Starting from its fourth year of reporting under ESRS, the undertaking shall comply with
ESRS 1 paragraph 63 (ESRS 1 paragraph 135) as explained in this document.
89. In addition to the transitional provisions described above, Appendix C of ESRS 1
specifies that for ESRS E1-6 Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions,
undertakings or groups with less than an average of 750 employees at balance sheet
dates, may omit datapoints on Scope 3 emissions and the total GHG emissions for the
first year of preparation of their sustainability statement. Similarly, the disclosure
requirements for ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain, ESRS S3 Affected communities
and ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users may be omitted for the first two years by
undertakings that have 750 or less employees during the financial year.
Transitional provision with respect to entity-specific disclosures
90. The provision of entity-specific disclosure under ESRS 1 paragraph 11 is not optional
in the first three annual sustainability statements. It is mandatory. In the first three
annual sustainability statements, when the reporting undertaking is defining its entity-
specific disclosures, it may as a priority:
(a) include disclosures it previously reported (where these meet the qualitative
characteristics of information per Chapter 2 of ESRS 1); and
(b) add disclosures to cover those material sustainability matters in its sector(s) using
the available best practice and/or available frameworks (such as IFRS or GRI sector-
specific requirements).
May 2024 Page 23 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
91. The transitional provision related to value chain (paragraphs 132 to 135 of ESRS 1)
covers also the VC information to be covered by entity-specific disclosures. There is no
three-year transition with respect to entity-specific disclosures that do not include the
VC. Given that entity-specific disclosures may trigger the inclusion of VC information,
the transitional provision applying to entity-specific disclosures (ESRS 1 paragraph
131) is also relevant here.
2.8 What is the LSME cap and does it impact one’s disclosures?
92. Article 29b (4) of the CSRD limits the VC information that the ESRS shall require
undertakings in the scope of the CSRD to obtain from small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) for their reporting under ESRS. ESRS may not require disclosures
which will result in reporting undertakings having to request information from the
SMEs in their VC (either listed or not listed) if such information goes beyond the
disclosures required in the listed SME (LSME) ESRS.
93. This limitation is often referred to as the ‘LSME cap’ and it aims at limiting the burden
for SMEs and to embed proportionality in the ESRS.
94. The LSME ESRS are still under development and are expected to be finalized by
EFRAG in December 2024.
3. Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
95. This chapter provides further practical guidance on the VC principles described in the
previous chapter.
FAQ 1: Where does the VC begin and end?
96. ESRS requires the undertaking to identify and assess material IROs across its entire VC
from a double materiality perspective. In this regard:
(a) relevant impacts are defined as those that are connected to the undertaking, which
includes when they are either caused by or contributed to or that are directly linked
to the undertaking’s operations, products or services through a business
relationship. The relevant impacts are not ringfenced by proximity or contractual
relationship, but by the fact that they occur in connection to the processes at any
stage of the VC that contribute to the undertaking’s operations, products or
services, or that result from the use or end-use of those products or services.
Conversely, the impacts of actors in the value chain not connected to the
undertaking’s operations, products and services are outside of the scope of impact
materiality (see also IG 1 FAQ 2 What is meant by the undertaking being
‘connected’ to an impact?); and
(b) relevant risks and opportunities are those attributable to business relationships, in
particularly with actors in the VC that are beyond the scope of consolidation used
for the preparation of financial statements for financial materiality (ESRS 1
paragraph 49).
97. To assess potential and actual impacts, it is important that the undertaking identify in
particular:
(a) the location and characteristics of suppliers including beyond the first tier of their
upstream VC or supply chain;
May 2024 Page 24 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
(b) the users of their services and goods;
(c) how the goods are treated in terms of waste at the end of their life; and
(d) who may be affected by their services and goods.
98. See FAQ 7 How to assess and quantify the impacts of the VC resulting from business
relationships? below for recommendations on how to organise the processes to
identify and assess material impacts across the VC.
99. To assess risks and opportunities, the undertaking considers its own dependencies on
natural, human and social resources. The undertaking identifies potential changes in
the availability, price and quality of such resources, which are sources of risks and
opportunities, including those stemming from its upstream and downstream VC. The
following three examples illustrate this concept.
(a) A company has a tier-1 supplier, that provides it with the main components of its
final products, in a region with water scarcity. To provide the components, the
supplier needs minerals from a mining company which is heavily dependent on a
supply of water. As such, this supplier would be at risk if one of the mines was no
longer able to access sufficient water from its existing sources. Consequently, the
supplier may face physical risks in the future due to the water scarcity in the region,
which could lead to operational disruptions and increased costs. This situation
could lead to discontinuities in the supply of steel with disruptions in production;
(b) If the buying price does not cover the cost of a product bought, it may increase the
pressure on the working conditions for the suppliers. If the purchasing department
of the reporting entity does not understand lead times or ignores lead times when
ordering this, could have a negative effect on the workforce of their contractual
partners in terms of overtime, accidents or use of forced labour;
(c) A company active in the food sector needs to be constantly supplied with natural
key inputs (such as flours). One of its main suppliers is active in a region at high risk
of biodiversity loss and following the request by local authorities to restore
damaged habitats it has a more variable production of key natural inputs and
higher production costs. This situation could lead to disruptions in the supply of
key natural inputs, creating consequences for the production of the company
active in the food sector. Active spot markets with delivery close to the company
may alleviate the risk of disruption but may have implications for pricing.
FAQ 2: Are financial assets (loans, equity and debt investments)
considered business relationships that trigger VC information?
100. Yes- business relationships and VC, as defined in Annex 2 of the July 2023 Delegated
Act does not exclude any types of activities or business relationships.
101. ESRS 1 AR 12(b) explains that where the reporting undertaking provides financial loans
to another enterprise that ultimately results in the contamination of water and land
surrounding the operations of such enterprise, this negative impact is connected to
the reporting undertaking by way of the relationship created by the loan agreement.
102. Per paragraph 66, for investments there is currently only a specific disclosure provision
under Category 15 of GHG emissions where significant under ESRS E1.
May 2024 Page 25 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
103. EFRAG plans to work on the development of further draft standards or guidelines for
financial institutions, and on that occasion, specific solutions will be consulted on for
comments.
FAQ 3: How should the MA process be organised to properly
capture material IROs in the VC?
1. Basic principles
104. The materiality process is the process by which the undertaking determines material
information on sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities and this includes
information related to the VC, but not information on each and every actor in the VC.
Therefore, for the identification of impacts, risks and opportunities within the
materiality assessment, the undertaking should focus on the parts of its value chains
where material impacts are most likely to occur. In general, the starting point is the
assessment of impacts, although there may also be material risks and opportunities
that are not related to the undertaking’s impacts. As outlined in IG 1 Chapter 3 How is
the materiality assessment performed?, the undertaking should design a process that
is fit for this purpose, as required by ESRS 1 Chapter 3 and disclose it, per the
requirements set out in ESRS 2 IRO-1. An undertaking, shall design a process that is
fit for this purpose based on its specific facts and circumstances, factoring in
consideration of the depth of the assessment. This principle also applies to the value
chain.
105. The ESRS clarify that the materiality assessment process is informed by the due
diligence process (where relevant).
2. Materiality assessment steps
106. Guidance on the organisation of the materiality assessment process can be found in
IG 1 Chapter 3 How is the materiality assessment performed? As explained there
(emphasis added): ‘ESRS do not mandate how the materiality assessment shall be
conducted by an undertaking, or how the process should be designed. No one
process would suit all types of economic activities, location(s), business relationships
or value chains (upstream and/or downstream) of all the undertakings applying ESRS.
An undertaking, based on its specific facts and circumstances, shall design a process
that is fit for purpose considering the requirements of ESRS 1 Chapter 3, and what
needs to be disclosed regarding the materiality assessment and its outcome (see ESRS
2 IRO-1, IRO-2 and SBM-3). Therefore, the ESRS provide several aspects that an
undertaking takes account of when designing the materiality assessment process.’
107. With this caveat, IG 1 provides guidance for the general organisation of the MA
process. The guidance included below reflects how VC aspects can be considered in
the possible process.
Step A. Understanding the context
108. As explained in IG 1, the first step in the MA process is understanding the context in
which the undertaking operates. Therefore, the undertaking needs to understand its
VC in terms of the business actors involved, their size, the sectors or nature of their
activities, geographical locations, and processes. This is a starting point for the
identification of where IROs are likely to arise.
May 2024 Page 26 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
109. The context also includes understanding the undertaking’s strategy and business
model and how they are connected to possible material IROs.
110. The strategy of the undertaking will influence its business model, which will focus on
its own operations but also include aspects around its upstream and downstream value
chain. All of this will be considered in its materiality assessment.
111. The undertaking can consider tracing or mapping its VC activities and actors to identify
whether and which parts of its value chains are in areas of heightened risks. In some
cases, if the undertaking does not have reliable information on the geographical
location of its VC (for example beyond the first tier), it may map the IROs associated
with global value chains for materials, products and services it uses or produces, to the
extent that they are relevant to its VC. For example, a chair manufacturer may use
products such as steel, wood, foam and fabric in its business. These raise questions
around the origin of their components (e.g. oil used to produce foam and cotton for
the fabric) and the transportation used to deliver them to the undertaking. Are there
any environmental (deforestation, biodiversity, water usage) or social issues (working
conditions, impact on communities) in the countries of origin of the components?
What are the sustainability matters pertaining to the consumers? Here the sales
channels may be relevant as well as the ability to re-use, re-cycle or up-cycle the
furniture at the end of its life.
112. As explained in the general instructions in IG 1, engagement with affected
stakeholders can support the assessment and validation of the impacts. The
undertaking should also identify (likely) affected stakeholders and consider engaging
with them. See also IG 1 FAQ 17 What is the role of silent stakeholders and how should
they be considered?
Step B. and Step C: Identification of actual and potential IROs as well as assessment
and determination of the material IROs
113. Identification and assessment of impacts can be challenging for those parts of the VC
where the undertaking is not able to trace materials and products. ESRS 2 paragraph
5 c) requires a description of the extent to which the disclosures cover the
undertaking’s upstream and downstream VC.
114. The undertaking should aim to gather reliable data from actors in its VC, when
inclusion of VC information is needed according to ESRS 1.65. If this is not possible
after having made reasonable efforts, it may rely as appropriate on sources of
secondary data. Secondary data include information such as publicly available reports
and studies, sector proxies, data from local, regional and national authorities,
newspaper articles, databases, etc. used to estimate the IROs where this provides
relevant and faithfully representative information.
Assessment of the involvement of the undertaking with the VC
115. The undertaking is required to provide a description of the material impacts, risks and
opportunities connected to it, as well as those that are directly linked to its operations
and services in its upstream or downstream value chain (ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48
(a)).
116. As explained in IG 1, FAQ 2 What is meant by the undertaking being ‘connected’ with
an impact? the undertaking may for instance be involved in a breach of labour
standards through its procurement and payment policies and practices, or even by
sourcing from suppliers with cases of labour rights abuse.
May 2024 Page 27 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
117. The contribution to the impacts in the VC may concern direct business relationships.
However, the undertaking may find itself contributing to impacts that occur in more
distant parts of the VC. This may, for instance, be the case when the undertaking or its
direct suppliers are using commodities or components whose production is
associated with severe systemic impacts, such as palm oil or coltan. Similarly, the
undertaking may be contributing to impacts that result from the use of its products,
such as oil and gas derived from fossil fuels, plastics contributing to microplastics
pollution, cigarettes, or pesticides.
118. An undertaking can cause, contribute or be directly linked to an impact in the value
chain. Distinguishing the type of involvement is important given that it could lead to a
different assessment or categorisation of the negative impact.
Environmental topical standards on the materiality assessment
119. Environmental standards use the concept of life cycle or life cycle assessment, which
also covers value chain, in the context of the materiality assessment. In particular:
(a) ESRS E2 AR 18: ‘In order to assess materiality, the undertaking may consider
Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 on the use of the Environmental
Footprint methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental
performance of products and organisations’;
(b) ESRS E3 AR 14: ‘The undertaking may rely on primary, secondary or modelled data
collection or other relevant approaches to assess material impacts, dependencies,
risks and opportunities, including Commission Recommendation 2021/2279 on
the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to measure and communicate the
life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (Annex I –
Product Environmental Footprint; Annex III – Organisation Environmental
Footprint)’;
(c) ESRS E5: the concept of 'life cycle’ is so important that it is part of the objective in
paragraph 3 and AR 6, which explain its use in assessing IROs in own operations
and the VC.
FAQ 4: How should information about the VC be disclosed in
the context of the materiality assessment?
120. The disclosure of information about the VC is required in two steps: as a component
of (i) the materiality assessment process and of (ii) the outcome of the materiality
assessment.
BP-1 – General basis for preparation of the sustainability statement
121. ESRS 2 paragraph 5(c) requires disclosing to which extent the sustainability statement
covers the undertaking’s upstream and downstream VC. Therefore, in addition to
metrics, this applies to all the steps listed below to the extent that material IROs arise
in the upstream and downstream VC.
SBM-1 – Market position, strategy, business model(s) and VC – ‘VC
mapping’
122. To provide an understanding of where in the undertaking’s VC material IROs may arise,
ESRS 2 paragraph 42(c) in SBM-1 requires the following in the description of its VC:
May 2024 Page 28 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
(a) the main features of its upstream and downstream VC;
(b) the undertaking’s position in its VC; and
(c) the description of the main business actors and their relationship to the
undertaking, including:
(i) key suppliers,
(ii) key distribution channels, and
(iii) key customers and/or end users.
123. Identifying the key actors requires judgement to reflect the specific circumstances of
the undertaking’s VC and should involve consideration of both impact and financial
materiality criteria.
124. The mapping of the VC for material impacts is expected to use the sustainability due
diligence process when it is in place. However, the due diligence process may go
beyond such mapping per se as explained below, looking at the impacts throughout
the VC and identifying potential ‘hot spots’ by cross-referencing countries where
materials are produced to social and environmental risk databases (i.e., Type of impact
by Country by Actor in the VC). These hotspots may then be further investigated.
IRO-1 – VC considerations in MA
125. Subsequently, the undertaking shall describe its materiality assessment process,
including in relation to the VC, and the extent to which it may be informed by the due
diligence process.
126. ESRS 2 IRO-1 paragraph 53 (b)(ii) requires an overview of the process to identify, assess
and prioritise the impacts that the undertaking is involved in through its own
operations or because of its business relationships. Similarly, paragraph 53 requires
disclosing an overview of the process used to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor
risks and opportunities that have or may have financial effects, which may arise due to
the undertaking’s business relationships in the VC. In fact, the business relationships in
the upstream and downstream VC shall also be considered in the context of assessing
the materiality of risks and opportunities and not just for impacts (ESRS 1 paragraph
66).
127. A disclosure that meets these requirements could be structured as follows:
(a) the types of VC relationships that were considered in the materiality assessment;
(b) the methods that the undertaking used; and
(c) the sustainability topics that were evaluated.
128. For impacts, based on the initial mapping the undertaking may focus on areas where
actual or potential impacts could arise, which in turn reflect areas where negative
impacts are or could be severe. The undertaking will reasonably focus:
(a) on different types of business relationships and VC segments for different
sustainability matters; and
(b) on areas of heightened risk of adverse impacts, affected stakeholder engagement
and prioritisation based on criteria of severity and likelihood.
May 2024 Page 29 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
129. For risks and opportunities, this should include how the process considered any other
factors in the VC that are sources of IROs, including dependencies on natural and
social resources.
IRO-1 – MA methods and assumptions
130. ESRS 2 IRO-1 requires information on methods and assumptions applied in the
materiality assessment (ESRS 2 paragraph 53(a)), including thresholds, to assess
materiality (paragraph 53(b)(iv)). This should account for any specifics related to the
VC. As per ESRS 2 BP-1, the undertaking should describe the extent of any limitations
on the materiality assessment process with respect to the VC.
SBM-3 – Disclosing the outcome of the MA
131. As a result of the materiality assessment, the undertaking shall disclose the material
IROs originating in its VC. ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48(a) requires disclosing ‘where in
its business model, its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain
these material impacts, risks and opportunities are concentrated’.
132. The preparation of this disclosure may use evidence of impacts from the due diligence
process, such as the concentration of types of impacts by country or operational step.
133. ESRS 2 SBM-3 also requires describing the material impacts identified following the
materiality assessment process disclosed under IRO-1, specifying ‘whether the
undertaking is involved with the material impacts through its activities or because of
its business relationships, describing the nature of the activities or business
relationships concerned’ (ESRS 2 paragraph 48 (c)(iv)).
134. ESRS 2 paragraph 48(b) requires as well disclosure of ‘the current and anticipated
effects of [the undertaking’s] material impacts, risks and opportunities on its business
model, value chain, strategy and decision-making, and how it has responded or plans
to respond to these effects, including any changes it has made or plans to make to its
strategy or business model as part of its actions to address particular material impacts
or risks, or to pursue particular material opportunities’.
135. This implies that when strategically important hotspots for VC IROs have been
identified, ESRS 2 SBM-3 requires information about discussions of the impacts at the
relevant managerial level or governance bodies in charge (paragraph 48(b)).
136. The disclosures should be consistent with the corresponding information on whether
and how the VC was considered in the materiality assessment.
137. The information required by ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48(a)(b) (such as the effects on
and changes in the VC, the undertaking’s business strategy and how it responds or
plans to respond to those effects) should enable an understanding of the
undertaking’s basic ability to influence those IROs and any potential effects on the
undertaking.
138. When providing information required by ESRS SBM-3 on material IROs or PAT,
qualitative information may be sufficient (for instance, for human rights policies with
respect to the VC). However, quantitative information may be required to help users
understand impacts, their severity and their likelihood and/or to track the effectiveness
of actions to manage them.

FAQ 5: How are investees treated under ESRS E1?
139. IG 2 refers to the terms associates, joint arrangements, joint operations, control, joint
control, investment entity, significant influence and joint ventures, having as a
reference the definitions per IFRS Accounting standards. Similar concepts exist in local
GAAP in EU countries, but the specifics may differ.
140. The table below illustrates the treatment of impacts arising from investments of the

FAQ 6: Reporting perimeter for ESRS E1 in practice
141. The following example of the corporate reporting of a fictional group, Seren, has been inspired in the GHG Protocol reporting
standard, pages 22 and 23.
142. Seren Group has a number of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates who are active in the production and marketing of
chemicals. Its group structure and investments are as follows:
(a) A wholly owned subsidiary, Seren UK. As Seren is the parent of Seren UK for financial reporting purposes, it also controls its
operational policies.
(b) A subsidiary called Seren US, which has 17% held by outside shareholders. Seren holds 83% of the shares.
(c) Seren US has a 75% stake in Pulsar, its subsidiary for financial reporting purposes. Ultimately, its operational policies are
determined by Seren (Seren has operational control).
(d) Galactica, a 50-50 joint arrangement between Seren US and Estrella classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Seren’s share of Galactica’s emissions are regarded as significant for the purposes of the GHG protocol. (Seren does not have
operational control).
(e) Seren holds a 43% stake in Sol, which it calls a joint venture with Alexa. However, Sol is classified as a subsidiary of Seren for
financial reporting purposes.
(f) Seren has joint control of Comet (33.3% stake) with two other parties. It is classified as a joint operation under IFRS 11. One of the
other joint operators has operational control. Seren’s share of emissions are regarded as significant. (Seren does not have
operational control).
(g) Seren has a 60% stake in Oril but share joint control with its partner. Oril is classified as a joint operation under IFRS 11, and Seren
is an operator of Oril. (Seren has operational control).
(h) Seren also has joint control of Cosmos with three other parties. Cosmos is classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11, with Seren
sharing the net assets of Cosmos. The emissions are regarded as significant. (Seren does not have operational control).
(i) Seren has joint control of Atom with another party. Atom is classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11, with Seren sharing the net
assets of Atom. In this case, Seren has operational control over Atom. (Seren has operational control).
(j) Nebu, an associate for financial reporting (IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) where Seren has operational
control. Seren holds 29% stake. (Seren has operational control).
May 2024 Page 33 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
(k) Seren holds 36% of Nova’s shares and has classified it as an associate for financial reporting purposes. Nova has control over its
own operations. (Seren does not have operational control).
(l) Seren holds 1% of Lumen’s shares. Seren’s share of emissions are regarded as insignificant (Seren does not have operational
control).
(m) Seren is the operator of Company X’s subsidiary, Asteri, in which Seren also holds 2.4%. (Seren has operational control.)
(n) Finally, Seren operates the Stea site owned by Company X. (Seren has operational control.)
143. The figure below depicts Seren Group, whereas the table following it sets out the reporting under ESRS and the GHG Protocol as well
as how these entities impact Seren’s profit before taxation.

FAQ 7: Numerical example of GHG emissions under ESRS E1
reporting
148. Company A is a global fashion company.
149. Company B is a producer of fabrics and has a GHG emissions total of 100,000 metric
tons (scope 1,2 and 3). How should GHG emissions be accounted for in Company A’s
consolidated sustainability statement in each of the following circumstances?
(a) A has operational control over B, and for financial reporting purposes Company B
is a subsidiary of Company A. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of B amount to
90,000 metric tons7;
(b) A does has no investment in B and does not exercise operational control over B.
Company B is a supplier of fabrics, and 80% of the fabrics produced by Company
B are supplied to Company A. Therefore, A and B have sales/transactions with each
other. It is assumed that category 1 (emissions from purchased goods and services)
is significant for company A;
(c) Company A holds a 30% ownership share in Company B, and for financial
reporting purposes, is an associate of Company A. Company A does not have
operational control or transactions with B (i.e., only the investment in equity). The
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions amount to 90,000 metric tons, and it is assumed
scope 3 emissions category 15 (emissions from investments) is significant for
company A.
150. Company A would report the following in its consolidated sustainability statement with
respect to Company B in each of the above scenarios. Note that the scenarios are
independent from each other.

EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
FAQ 8: How should the impacts resulting from business
relationships be assessed and quantified?
152. As set out in IG 1 FAQ 10 Should the assessment of IROs rely on quantitative
information? where qualitative analysis is sufficient for the undertaking to reasonably
conclude that a matter is ‘not material’, adding quantitative information to the analysis
would not bring much value to the materiality assessment, where the undertaking has
this data due to its sustainability and management practices as well as its engagement
with suppliers.
153. The materiality assessment regarding the upstream value chain may be validly
conducted by large undertakings without direct information from specific suppliers.
Undertakings reporting under the sector-agnostic standards may typically conduct the
assessment using average regional or sector data to characterise the areas of potential
impacts and risks associated with their value chain.
154. As mentioned above, the materiality assessment process evolves over time, and the
undertaking may be redefining the balance between qualitative and quantitative
information. Please refer to IG 1 Chapter 3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality – Setting
thresholds.
155. For the materiality assessment and for the inclusion of VC data required by metrics
(such as for Scope 3 GHG emissions and other entity-specific disclosures when
appropriate), the undertaking may either obtain information directly from actors in its
VC, use estimates or proxies, or combine both approaches.
156. Obtaining information directly is the most appropriate approach in certain cases, for
instance, for major tier 1 suppliers (the direct and substantial contractual relationship
is a good basis for organising appropriate flows of data) or for customers of products
and services, in particular when they are end users (the undertaking knows the
parameters of its products and services). When this is the case, the undertaking may
need to ask its suppliers and other relationships for information enabling the
quantification of the impacts. The undertaking may use questionnaires, surveys and
audits to obtain the information. Its buying power and overall contractual influence
may help in this regard.
157. It should be noted that the more severe the impact, the stronger the incentive to omit
such sensitive information, and this could impact the reliability of the information
provided by such supplier. This may be particularly relevant for incidents of child or
forced labour in the VC.
158. Apart from this issue, the reliability of information directly obtained from the VC may
improve over time since VC actors may not be able to quantify their impacts yet but
may be in the position to do so in the future, given the evolution of sustainability
reporting. Therefore, supporting such actors to set up effective systems may be
important. It may also be advisable to engage with them and, where relevant, to also
encourage them to do the same with their value chains.
159. Generally, the effort placed on actors in the VC should be proportionate and, as
mentioned above, undertakings do not have to report on each and all value chain
actors.
160. As set out in ESRS 1 paragraph 69 and further explained under FAQ 9 How can

EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
when necessary. Estimates and proxies may be used in combination with information
obtained directly as well as when quantification is required. Using estimates, like in
financial reporting, is acceptable if organised under a process designed to comply
with the qualitative characteristics of information expected from sustainability
information. Estimates and proxies may currently be the only available solution to
quantify impacts in certain cases due to the unreasonable efforts required to collect
data. Examples include tier 2 or tier N suppliers; tier 1 suppliers when they are
excessively high in number; and customers when they are not end users (e.g., when
the undertaking delivers products or services that are further transformed before
contributing to the delivery of products and services to the end users).
161. An example where obtaining primary data may not be possible and estimates may be
used is a beverage company that advises its drinks to be served cold, i.e., by using
refrigeration capacity, and it has determined energy use as a material matter. This
undertaking would find it impossible to precisely measure its impact with each and
every customer. However, from its materiality assessment, it assesses that electricity
use is a significant part of its impact in the downstream VC. In this case, estimating its
impact would involve considering variables such as volumes sold, the average time in
which the inventory will be cooled before consumption and an estimate of the average
electricity used to cool its products on a unit basis. This may need to also consider the
location and related prices. Depending on its assessment of the materiality of
electricity use, the undertaking may want to provide a sensitivity analysis of its
electricity use depending on reasonably possible changes in the important variables
in its calculations. Proxies are often available at sector or product level. In all cases, the
undertaking shall clearly explain the basis for its estimates and the proxies used as well
as any factor affecting their consistency over time.
162. ESRS 2 paragraph 10 requires the undertaking to disclose the metrics that include VC
data estimated using indirect sources, including the basis for preparation, the resulting
level of accuracy and the planned actions to improve accuracy in the future.
FAQ 9: What is ‘reasonable effort’ to collect VC data?
163. When inclusion of VC information is necessary under ESRS 1 paragraph 63 or on an
entity-specific basis, a reporting entity collects information about its upstream and
downstream VC only to the extent that this is compatible with a reasonable effort
(ESRS 1 paragraph 69) for use in its sustainability statement. In all other circumstances,
it shall estimate the missing information based on ‘all reasonable and supportable
information that is available to the undertaking at the reporting date without undue
cost or effort’ (ESRS 1 paragraph AR 17). This includes estimates, sector-average data
and other proxies. For example, an undertaking could use country and/or sector-
statistic-based risk assessment data. If more details are known, such as the specific
location of farming and manufacturing processes, more specific data may be made
available. Also refer to paragraph 160 on the need to comply with the quality of
characteristics requirement.
164. The undertaking should determine the best available way to prepare meaningful VC
information and dedicate proportionate resources once the degree of difficulty has
been properly assessed.
165. As explained above, the undertaking should report on material IROs in its own
operations and in its upstream and downstream VC. In this context, putting the
appropriate processes in place is a matter of management decision, internal
organisation and allocation of resources. ‘Reasonable effort’ and ‘undue cost or effort’
May 2024 Page 40 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
relate to the processes put in place by the undertaking to collect VC information and
the amount of resources dedicated to these processes. ‘Reasonable effort’ cannot be
an excuse for not disclosing. ‘Reasonable effort’ and ‘undue cost and effort’ depend
on facts and circumstances specific to the undertaking. On the basis of FAQ 7 above,
using free and publicly available information may in some cases be considered a
reasonable effort. In determining whether an action is beyond ‘reasonable effort’
and/or beyond ‘undue cost and effort’, the undertaking shall balance the reporting
burden of obtaining direct data and the potential lower quality of the information
resulting from not undertaking that action. The estimation procedures adopted by the
undertaking when direct data are not used are subject to ESRS 2 paragraph 10.
166. For VC data, a good starting point is a deep understanding of what, where and how
inputs for its products and/or services are sourced upstream and/or what, where and
how its products and services are brought to market downstream.
167. ESRS 1 paragraph 68 indicates that the undertaking’s ability to obtain VC information
may vary depending on factors such as its contractual arrangements, the level of
control it may exercise beyond the consolidation perimeter and its buying power.
Therefore, there are cases where obtaining the information may be more challenging.
In such cases, the undertaking may use other sources of information. For example, an
undertaking may have a major exposure to forced labour because it is getting
significant volumes of agricultural commodities and products from jurisdictions where
forced labour in agriculture has been documented by the ILO (the International Labour
Organisation) and the FAO (the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN). For the
materiality assessment, it is not necessary for the undertaking to change practices and
estimate the number of cases of child or forced labour in its value chain. What is
important is that it has enough information to conclude that the impacts are severe
(based on scale, severity and irremediability).
168. Similarly, undertakings calculating their full environmental footprint may use estimates
not only because it would be unreasonable to get primary data but also because such
data would not be reliable.
169. In the context of materiality assessment, the focus on the VC and VC information
should be where the undertaking is expected to have a severe negative impact (on
people and the environment). This means that general impact assessments could be
useful for the initial work on collecting VC information. Examples include general
information about the undertaking’s region or sectors of sourcing. For example, where
an undertaking is sourcing its products mostly indirectly from Country A and Country
B, it may look at available general information about the minimum wage in those
countries when considering its social impacts. In Country A, the minimum wage is
generally 100% to 120% of the living wage, but in Country B the minimum wage is less
than 80% of the living wage. Therefore, the exposure to significant impacts is more
likely in Country B, all else being equal.
170. For its own governance as well as for purposes of an audit trail for its assurance
provider, it would be good for the undertaking to document its efforts, the outcomes
of these and how the information has been incorporated in its reporting process. (Refer
also to IG 1 FAQ 12 Should the materiality assessment be documented/evidenced?)
FAQ 10: How can estimates about the VC be developed?
171. As discussed in paragraph 28 above, primary VC information is not required for all
disclosures in the sustainability statement. Where the undertaking determines that VC
May 2024 Page 41 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
information is required and primary data (i.e., directly collected from the actor in the
VC) is not available after making reasonable efforts, estimated data can be used.
172. In estimating the missing information, ESRS require using internal and external
information. Such estimates can be used either for assessing material IROs or for
disclosing metrics in the VC, as outlined in ESRS 1 Chapter 5.2. When assessing
material IROs in the VC, a combination of primary data (i.e., directly collected from the
actor in the VC) and estimated data (using secondary data as input) can be employed.
173. Secondary data include data from indirect sources, sector-average data, sample
analyses, market and peer groups data, other proxies and spend-based data.
174. The adjacent text box lists some sources

collect the necessary data after making
reasonable efforts to do so, the undertaking may then need to rely on data from
indirect sources, like sector-average data, sample analyses, market and peer groups
data, other proxies, etc. For example, for VC workers extracting commodities used as
components of the undertaking’s products, the undertaking may be able to arrange
site audits. However, if those actions to obtain primary data and information are not
possible after reasonable effort, the undertaking may rely on sector or country data
estimating those impacts (e.g., negative impacts on safety, health; risk of child labour;
etc.) in the location of the mining activities.
176. Disclosing quantitative measures of indirect impacts does not produce relevant
information about the undertaking’s impacts in all circumstances. Consider a
manufacturer of bike parts who uses steel in its products and therefore has an issue
with pollution generated by its steel production. It is theoretically possible to estimate
the volume of pollution/quantify the environmental footprint, as some have done.
However, this may not be necessary and would not be conducive to relevant
information, as it would fail to disclose on the undertaking’s contribution to mitigating
the pollution that derives from its products. The undertaking could instead measure its
performance in terms of ESRS E5 metrics on circular economy.
177. When a reporting entity does not have data received directly from VC actors after
making reasonable efforts, it shall estimate the information to be reported using sector
data or similar data as a starting point (ESRS 1 paragraph 69). Examples include Scope
3 emissions or living wage data on facilities in very high-risk countries, including
beyond the first tier of business relationships.
178. As set out in AR 73 of ESRS S1 Own workforce, the WageIndicator is indicated as a
potential source (along with others) for calculating adequate wage benchmarks
outside the EEA as the last option in the hierarchy. The WageIndicator provides
May 2024 Page 42 of 48
EFRAG IG 2: Value Chain Implementation Guidance
information about minimum and living wages for more than 200 countries, which could
be an example of applicable benchmarks as referred to under ESRS S1-10 Adequate
wages. Undertakings can use this information to explain prioritisation of actions and
targets in specific countries or regions for both own workforce and workers in the VC.
The information from such sources could become part of the undertaking’s
explanation under ESRS 2 SBM-3 on how it identified and assessed material IROs. The
exact living wages may differ in certain facilities and are dependent on the composition
of the worker’s family; however, these sources can be useful in the context of the
materiality assessment. Once wage has been identified as a material risk, more
accurate data may be needed to set targets and to report on progress.
179. Where deemed relevant, undertakings need to consider that setting up a reliable data
collection system which includes VC partners takes time. They may consider processes
and controls to collect the data and report the information. The quantity and quality of
VC information is likely to improve over time, but until then sector data or similar
sources can be a good starting point. As mentioned in paragraph 28 above,
information about each and every actor in the VC is not required.
180. The use of appropriate estimates or proxies is critical for the quality of reported
information. The origin of the data may influence the quality of the information
provided in the sustainability statement. Therefore, transparent disclosure and
explanation of the use of estimates are essential.
181. ESRS 2 BP-2 paragraph 10 requires preparers to:
(a) identify the metrics for which estimates are used;
(b) describe the basis for preparation;
(c) describe the resulting level of accuracy; and,
(d) where applicable, describe planned actions to improve accuracy in the future.
FAQ 11: Is a case of bribery not involving an employee relevant
for the reporting entity?
182. Consider a case where Q, an employee at a customer (XYZ) of the reporting
undertaking (ABC), was found to have been bribed by S, an employee at one of XYZ’s
suppliers. In this case, ABC would not have to disclose this under the metrics of ESRS
G1-4 as an employee of the reporting undertaking is not involved in the case, as
explained in ESRS G1 paragraph 26. However, ABC would consider this information
when it considers the risks around corruption and bribery in the sector/geographical
area going forward.
