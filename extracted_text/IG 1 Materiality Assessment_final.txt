EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
Summary in 13 key points
1. The ESRS sustainability statement shall include relevant and faithful
information about all impacts, risks and opportunities (also referred to as IROs)
across environmental, social and governance matters determined to be
material from the impact materiality perspective, the financial materiality
perspective or both. The materiality assessment is the process by which the
undertaking determines material information on sustainability IROs. This is
achieved by the determination of material matters and material information to
be reported. The performance of a materiality assessment based on objective
criteria is pivotal to sustainability reporting. The undertaking will use
judgement when applying the criteria, and the related explanations are
expected to provide transparency from the undertaking to the users of the
sustainability statement.
2. The assessment considers the undertaking’s entire value chain, i.e., it includes
the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain in addition to its own
operations.
3. Once the undertaking has identified an impact, risk or opportunity related to
a sustainability matter as material, it firstly refers to the related Disclosure
Requirements to identify the relevant information to be considered on the
matter. Secondly, if the impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or
insufficiently covered by the ESRS, the undertaking shall provide entity-specific
disclosure on the matter. Relevance is the criterion to identify the information
to be disclosed and is based on (a) the significance of the information in
relation to the matter it depicts or (b) its decision-usefulness.
4. Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2 addressing cross-cutting matters are to be
reported irrespective of the outcome of the materiality assessment. For
policies, actions and targets, information shall either be disclosed according
to the Disclosure Requirements or it shall be stated that the undertaking does
not have policies, actions or targets related to the material sustainability
matter. Metrics are subject to materiality assessment: the information defined
in the relevant Disclosure Requirements shall be included when the
undertaking has assessed the metrics to be material and it is omitted if this is
not the case. Having followed a structured materiality assessment, such an
omission indicates to users that a metric is not material. Omissions are useful
sustainability-related information, supporting the general coherence of the
sustainability statement and, therefore, the fair coverage of sustainability
matters. The omission is explicit for datapoints derived from other EU
legislation (refer to ESRS 2 Appendix B for the list of these datapoints) and
implicit in other cases.
5. The ESRS do not mandate a specific process or sequence of steps to follow
when performing the materiality assessment, and so this is left to the
judgement of the undertaking. Whichever process is used, it should reflect the
undertaking’s facts and circumstances.
6. As an illustration, a materiality assessment that would meet the requirements
of the ESRS could include the following steps:
(a) understanding of the context;
May 2024 Page 5 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(b) identification of actual and potential IROs related to sustainability
matters;
(c) assessment and determination of the material IROs related to
sustainability matters; and
(d) reporting.
7. Engagement with affected stakeholders informs the materiality assessment
process, and it is consistent with the practice suggested by the international
instruments of due diligence referenced in the CSRD. This entails seeking
input and feedback to understand concerns and evidence about actual and
potential impacts of the undertaking on people and the environment. It also
helps to substantiate the importance of the sustainability matters from the
perspective of the affected stakeholder groups. However, the ESRS do not
mandate specific behaviour on stakeholder engagement and do not pre-empt
the content of the CSDDD currently under definition in the EU legislative
process.
8. The undertaking assesses the materiality of impacts for reporting purposes
against criteria of severity and likelihood. This also includes setting
appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds for reporting purposes.
Severity is based on the scale, scope and irremediable character of negative
impacts and the scale and scope of positive impacts.
9. Material risks and opportunities for the undertaking generally derive either
from impacts or from dependencies and other risk factors. Undertakings
assess the materiality of their risks and opportunities based on appropriate
quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds related to anticipated financial
effects on performance, financial position cash flows and access to finance,
including cost of capital.
10. The due diligence process, per the related international instruments, can help
an undertaking both (a) to identify and assess its actual and potential negative
impacts as well as (b) to assess their materiality for reporting purposes based
on the criteria of severity and likelihood.
11. When undertakings perform an assessment under the GRI Universal
Standards, the GRI assessment constitutes a good basis for the assessment of
impacts under the ESRS.
12. An undertaking that applies the ESRS is expected to be able to comply with
the identification of sustainability-related information on risks and
opportunities under IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (also known as
ISSB Standards). This reflects an alignment in scope between financial
materiality in ISSB standards and the ESRS.
13. Upon completing the materiality assessment process, the undertaking shall
disclose:
(a) the process to identify and assess its material IROs (ESRS 2 IRO-1);
(b) the interaction of its material IROs with its strategy and business model
(ESRS 2 SBM-3); and
(c) the Disclosure Requirements under the ESRS covered by its
sustainability statement (ESRS 2 IRO-2).

EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
1. Introduction
14. The objective of this non-authoritative Guidance is to support the
implementation activities of preparers and others using or analysing ESRS
reports with regard to the double materiality assessment (referred to as ‘the
materiality assessment’, ‘the assessment’ and ‘the MA’ in this document).
Hence, this Guidance does not introduce new provisions to the ESRS as these
can only result from future standard-setting activities (e.g., future possible
amendments to draft ESRS) conducted in accordance with EFRAG’s due
process. Where content in this Guidance is seen to contradict the
requirements in the ESRS, those requirements supersede.
15. Due to the principles-based nature of the ESRS requirements – particularly on
this topic – there is no single solution for all undertakings in respect of
designing processes and adopting methodologies. Hence, this Guidance
provides tools and mechanisms for undertakings to comply with the ESRS
while taking full account of their specific facts and circumstances (including
their business model, strategy, legal structure, complexity and governance).
Therefore, the illustrations on how to apply the criteria in ESRS 1 General
requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures in this Guidance, including
examples and depictions, do not constitute the only possible approach to
implementing the ESRS requirements.
16. The content of this document has been developed by EFRAG on the basis of
the July 2023 Delegated Act on the ESRS adopted regulation, in accordance
with the requirements of Articles 19a and 29a of the Directive 2013/34/EU
(referred to as the ‘Accounting Directive’) as amended following the Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (referred to as ‘the CSRD’).
17. This Guidance includes responses to FAQs on the interoperability with ISSB
and GRI Universal Standards, illustrating the interactions between the
corresponding materiality concepts and assessment processes when
applicable.
18. This Guidance also includes responses to FAQs related to international
instruments and to reporting standards that will be useful when performing
the materiality assessment and that are referenced in the CSRD. In the case of
due diligence, these are the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
issued by the United Nations as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business
Conduct, which have been used as a basis for the preparation of this
document. This Guidance acknowledges that market practice is currently
developing for double materiality assessment and that there are still no
examples of sustainability statements prepared under the ESRS.
Structure of the Guidance
19. This document is organised as follows:
(a) Chapter 2 explains the ESRS approach to materiality;
(b) Chapter 3 illustrates how the materiality assessment is performed;
May 2024 Page 7 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(c) Chapter 4 explains how undertakings could take account of other
frameworks/standards or sources; and
(d) Chapter 5 complements chapters 2 to 4 with responses to FAQs on:
i. impact materiality;
ii. financial materiality;
iii. the materiality assessment process;
iv. stakeholder engagement;
v. aggregation/disaggregation; and
vi. reporting.
Cross-references to IG 2
20. To avoid duplication and reduce the length of this document, there is
significant reference to the Value Chain Implementation Guidance (IG 2)
developed by EFRAG. In-depth analysis and further examples of due diligence
aspects related to the materiality assessment (as well as some VC aspects) are
covered in that guidance more so than here.

2. The ESRS approach to materiality
23. The ESRS require that the sustainability statement include sustainability
information related to material IROs identified through a MA process that
applies the principles of double materiality.
24. Double materiality covers both impact and financial materiality. Impact
materiality pertains to the material information about the undertaking’s
impacts on people or the environment related to a sustainability matter;
financial materiality pertains to the material information about risks and
opportunities related to a sustainability matter. The terms ‘material’ and
‘materiality’ are used throughout the ESRS to refer to double materiality unless
otherwise specified (also referred to in this document as ‘materiality’).
25. The identification of the material matters is the starting point to determine the
material information to be disclosed in the sustainability statement on material
IROs related to those matters. Material IROs related to environmental, social
and governance matters that are to be reported are those that arise in the
undertaking’s own operations as well as in its upstream and downstream value
chain. If the MA process is not appropriately designed, the undertaking may
provide incomplete reporting (with material IROs not being disclosed).
Following the provisions in ESRS 1 paragraph 114, in addition to the disclosure
of material matters identified during the MA process, the undertaking may
provide additional information stemming from other legislation as well as from
generally accepted sustainability reporting standards and frameworks (for
example, SASB Standards or GRI Standards). This may include additional
information that is required by stakeholders.
26. If the undertaking identifies a large number of IROs, it may prioritise them for
management purposes. However, for reporting purposes this assessment
should not exclude any material IROs, particularly when the undertaking has
not addressed or fully addressed these material IROs through its policies,
targets and action plans. This is useful information and shall therefore be
included irrespective of whether actions have been taken, or are planned to
be taken, to address them (refer to ESRS 2 MDR-P, MDR-A and MDR-T).
27. ESRS 1 sets criteria for the materiality assessment but not specific thresholds
to determine when a matter or information is material or not. Therefore, the
assessment requires the exercise of judgement. The undertaking needs to set
thresholds based on ESRS 1 criteria as well as its own specific facts and
circumstances. The need for judgement will be higher whenever the
information and evidence about the materiality of a given IRO is inconclusive.
28. The sustainability statement shall be prepared according to the qualitative
characteristics of information (refer to ESRS 1 and Appendix B). For materiality-
assessment-related disclosures, relevance, faithful representation and
1 Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on
sustainability‐related disclosures in the financial services sector (Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation) (OJ L
317, 9.12.2019, p. 1).
May 2024 Page 9 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
verifiability of information are particularly important. The materiality
assessment should be based upon supportable evidence and rely to the
maximum extent possible, on objective information, while implementing the
impact materiality and financial materiality criteria specified in the ESRS (ESRS
1 chapters 3.4 and 3.5).
29. The ESRS require undertakings to disclose the materiality assessment process
and its outcome. This includes the following information: methodologies and
assumptions applied, the focus and extent of the process, and inputs. ESRS 2
IRO-1 and IRO-2 also require transparency on the judgement exercised, i.e.
quantitative or qualitative thresholds and other criteria used. Refer to Chapter
3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality – Setting thresholds and Chapter 3.7
Deep dive into financial materiality – Setting thresholds in this Guidance for
more information.
30. To meet the required qualitative characteristics of information (Appendix B of
ESRS 1), the MA process (including criteria and thresholds applied as well as
conclusions) should be consistent with internal and other external reporting.
Consistency with sustainability management policies and actions is also
required, including fulfilling sustainability-related laws and regulations.
31. The undertaking may briefly explain the conclusions of its materiality
assessment in relation to any omitted topic or topics. However, the
undertaking is required to provide explanations if it concludes that it has no
material IROs with respect to climate change and therefore omits disclosures
required per ESRS E1 Climate Change. The undertaking shall also report on
material matters that are not covered or that are covered insufficiently in the
topical ESRS in the form of entity-specific information (ESRS 1 paragraph 11).
32. Once the undertaking has identified the material matters, it then assesses the
information to be reported for each material matter based on the materiality
of information (ESRS 1 paragraphs 30, 31, 33 and 34). The concept of
materiality of information applies to the requirements at a more granular level,
i.e., at the Disclosure Requirement or the datapoint level. Refer to Chapter 2.3
Criteria to determine the materiality of information and Chapter 2.4 Scope of
application of the materiality of information. for more on this granular
application of the concept.
2.1 Implementing the concept of double materiality
33. As discussed above, the CSRD requires that sustainability reporting be based
on double materiality. A sustainability matter can be material from an impact
perspective, from a financial perspective or from both (see ESRS 1 Chapter 3;
refer to figure 1 (a) below).
34. The ESRS include definitions of these two materiality dimensions. A
sustainability matter is material from:
(a) ‘an impact perspective when it pertains to the undertaking’s material
actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on people or the
environment over the short-, medium- and long-term. Impacts include
those connected with the undertaking’s own operations and the
upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products
May 2024 Page 10 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
and services, as well as through its business relationships’ (ESRS 1
paragraph 43); and from
(b) ‘a financial perspective if it triggers or could reasonably be expected to
trigger material financial effects on the undertaking. This is the case
when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have
a material influence or that could reasonably be expected to have a
material influence on the undertaking’s development, financial
position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of
capital over the short-, medium- or long-term … The financial
materiality assessment corresponds to the identification of information
that is considered material for primary users of general-purpose
financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to
the entity. In particular, information is considered material for primary
users of general-purpose financial reports if omitting, misstating or
obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence
decisions that they make on the basis of the undertaking’s sustainability
statement’ (ESRS 1 paragraphs 49 and 48). In this document, the terms
“risks” and “opportunities” are used to identify the financial risks and
opportunities that are in the scope of financial materiality.’
35. Impact materiality and financial materiality are often intertwined (refer to figure
1(a) and 1(b) below). The undertaking’s impacts on people or the environment,
combined with changes to strategy – including in investments – as well as in
management decisions made to address such impacts, may give rise to risks
and opportunities. Material risks and opportunities generally derive from
impacts and dependencies.

Figure 1(c). Interaction between ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 and the assessment of
material impacts, risks and opportunities.
36. A possible practical perspective in the MA process considering both impact
and financial materiality is summarised below (refer to figure 1(b) above):
(a) identification of impacts;
(b) assessment of whether such impacts lead to risks and opportunities
(refer to paragraph 37 below). This includes, but is not limited to, risks
and opportunities that derive from dependencies on resources; and
(c) identification of risks and opportunities not sourced from impacts (refer
to paragraph 38 below for examples). This includes, but is not limited
to, those risks and opportunities that derive from dependencies, where
impacts do not affect that resource2.
37. For most material impacts, a material risk and/or opportunity may emerge over
time. The examples on next page include negative and positive impacts.
2 The undertaking shall consider how it is affected by its dependencies on the availability of natural, human and
social resources at appropriate prices and quality irrespective of its potential impacts on those resources (ESRS 1
paragraph 40).

of employees, individually or as a whole, may sue for financial
compensation at a later stage on the grounds of gender discrimination
and cause reputational damage to the undertaking.
38. Material risks and opportunities also arise in the absence of material impacts
connected to the undertaking, such as when they arise from dependencies on
natural and human resources. Consider, for example, cases such as the
following:
(a) an undertaking is active in organic agriculture, which depends on
pollinators. The number of pollinators is decreasing due to pesticide
use by other agricultural entities locally;
(b) an undertaking with a factory running on renewable energy producing
low GHG emissions. The undertaking is located in a coastal erosion
area and is exposed to climate-related physical risks, such as flooding
or extreme weather; and
(c) an undertaking that provides legal services to its customers may
experience an elevated level of staff turnover caused by a local
competitor offering higher salaries, even if both undertakings have
adequate working conditions and practices. Therefore, the
undertaking dependent on human capital may experience lower
income until new staff is recruited.
39. Sustainability-related regulatory developments that address systemic risks
may affect the prospects of the undertaking’s business. For example, risks can
arise from changes in the regulatory environment, such as a new pollution
May 2024 Page 14 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
abatement legislation that requires significant capital expenditure and
exposes the undertaking to sanctions.
40. Impact and financial materiality are two different but interrelated concepts,
and the interconnections between them shall be considered. This
consideration may require the application of judgement when organising the
materiality assessment, including on whether or not the two processes should
be divided in two or whether, should there be common steps among these
processes, . However, there is merit to maximising synergies among the two
processes to avoid gaps. Figure 1(c) above illustrates such synergies and how
ESRS 1 AR 16 is a common denominator for both impact and financial
materiality.
2.2 Sustainability matters for the materiality assessment
41. Sustainability matters are defined in the Annex 2 of the Delegated Act as
environmental, social and human rights as well as governance factors,
including sustainability factors defined in Article 2, point (24), of Regulation
(EU) 2019/2088 (i.e., SFDR).
42. The level of granularity of the matters to be considered ranges from topic to
subtopic level and, in some cases, to sub-subtopic level. The following table is
an extract from ESRS 1 AR 16 and sets out the relationship between topics,
subtopics and sub-subtopics (refer also to Figure 3 below).
Standard Topic Subtopic Sub-subtopic
ESRS E3 • Water and marine • Water • Water consumption
resources • Marine resources • Water withdrawals
• Water discharges
ESRS S1 • Own workforce • Other work-related • Child labour
rights • Forced labour
• Adequate housing
• Privacy
ESRS G1 • Business conduct • Corruption and • Prevention and detection
bribery • Incidents
43. As described in ESRS 1 paragraph 8, the three levels of granularity (i.e., topics,
subtopics and sub-subtopics) are collectively called ‘sustainability matters’.
44. To summarise:
(a) the goal of the assessment is to identify the material IROs related to
matters to be reported (ESRS 2 SBM 3);
(b) the matter is assessed as material when material impacts and/or
material risks or opportunities arise from it (ESRS 1 paragraph 43 and
49); and
(c) for each material matter, the undertaking determines the information
to be reported in accordance with the cross-cutting or topical
standards (ESRS 1 paragraph 30).
45. The undertaking is required to disclose its material IROs, which are in turn
mapped onto sustainability matters (i.e., topics, subtopics or sub-subtopics).
In preparing its disclosure according to ESRS 2 SBM-3, the aggregation rules
May 2024 Page 15 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
defined in ESRS 1 Chapter 3.7 also apply, which means that the undertaking
may aggregate information to the extent that it does not obscure material
content (ESRS 1 chapter 3.7). For more on this, refer to figure 2 below.
Figure 2. Relationships amongst various terms used
46. The undertaking needs to identify whether a topic, subtopic or sub-subtopic
is material from any of these two perspectives because the matter is associated
with either an identified material impact, risk or opportunity or both.
47. Once a matter has been identified as material, the undertaking refers to the
DR in the respective topical ESRS to identify the information to be disclosed
on the matter (ESRS 1 paragraphs 30 and 31). For example, if an undertaking
concludes that health and safety of its own workforce is material due to the
employees’ exposure to harmful chemical substances, it shall provide the
required information. This includes the disclosure requirements in ESRS S1-1
Policies, S1-4 Taking action, S1-5 Targets, and S1-14 Health and safety metrics.
Similarly, if an undertaking concludes that pollution of water is material, it shall
provide information under the DR in ESRS E2-1 Policies, E2-2 Actions and
resources, E2-3 Targets, E2-4 Pollution of air, water and soil and E2-6
Anticipated financial effects from material polluted-related risks and
opportunities.
48. In addition, as specified in paragraph 31, in some situations where a
sustainability matter is identified as material but is not covered by a ESRS (see
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 for a full list of matters) or not covered with sufficient
granularity by it, the undertaking shall provide additional entity-specific
disclosures (ESRS 1 paragraph 11).
49. In summary, once a given matter is assessed to be material, the information to
be disclosed is identified at the matter level following the datapoints of the
relevant DR in the topical standards. However, the outcome of the materiality
May 2024 Page 16 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
assessment (ESRS 2 SBM-3) is to be disclosed at the level of impacts, risks and
opportunities (or groups of them).
2.3 Criteria to determine the materiality of information
50. Determining the materiality of information is a step that follows from the
identification of material matters to be reported on (see Chapter 3 Materiality
assessment – how is it performed?), and it is applied at the more granular level
of DRs or datapoints. ESRS 1 paragraphs 31 and 33 to 35 set requirements on
how to assess the materiality of information.
51. The criteria to determine the materiality of information is based on relevance
(ESRS 1 paragraph 31): that is, on (a) the significance of the information in
relation to the matter it depicts or its (b) decision-usefulness. This is relevant
for the primary users of general-purpose financial information (i.e., financial
materiality-focused) and/or for other users whose interest is on the
undertaking’s impacts (i.e., impact materiality). In practice, information that is
relevant under perspective (b) (decision-usefulness) is in most cases also
relevant under perspective (a) (significance). However, there could be cases
where a piece of information is significant to depict the impacts of the
undertaking on people or the environment without necessarily being a
relevant input for the users of the sustainability statement in its decision-
making. When a matter is material from both an impact and a financial
perspective, the information needs from the two groups of users (investors and
others) will highly likely be the same in practice. In other cases, the information
may differ (refer to FAQ 21 If a matter is material from the financial (or impact)
perspective only, should disclosures cover all the requirements or only
information about the relevant perspective?).
52. In addition, the undertaking needs to apply the general requirements on
fundamental qualitative characteristics of information (relevance and faithful
representation) and the enhancing qualitative characteristics of information
(comparability, verifiability and understandability) (ESRS 1 Appendix B).
53. ESRS 2 IRO-2 requires an explanation of the determination of the information
to be disclosed in relation to the material IROs (i.e., materiality of information),
including the use of thresholds and/or how it has implemented the criteria in
ESRS 1 Chapter 3.2 Material matters and materiality of information.
54. An example of a materiality filter, when assessing which information in a topical
standard has to be provided (materiality of information), applies in the case
where the undertaking assesses labour rights (including collective bargaining)
as material. In this particular case, the undertaking concludes that the
datapoint under ESRS S1 paragraph 61 is not material information because all
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, according to the
disclosures of ESRS S1 paragraph 60(a)(b).
2.4 Scope of application of the materiality of information
55. The following paragraphs illustrate how the undertaking shall apply the filter
of materiality of information (see ESRS 1 paragraphs 31, 33-35) when
disclosing information on material sustainability matters.
May 2024 Page 17 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
56. The determination of the information to be reported for policies, actions and
targets in relation to a material matter is set out in the list of Minimum
Disclosure Requirements on policies, actions and targets (see Chapter 4.2
Minimum Disclosure Requirements on policies and actions and Chapter 5
Metrics and targets in ESRS 2); the information is not required for topics,
subtopics or sub-subtopics that are not deemed material. The datapoints in
the Minimum Disclosure Requirements depict the relevant information to a
user to assess the policies, actions and targets in relation to a material matter.
In addition, the filter of materiality of information (ESRS 1 paragraph 31) is
applied in determining the granularity of the description of the policies,
actions and targets. If the undertaking has not adopted policies, actions or
targets to manage a given material matter, it has to state this much, but no
additional information is required. There is also a voluntary disclosure on the
timeline to adopt such policies, actions or targets (ESRS 1 paragraph 33).
Reporting that the undertaking does not have policies, actions or targets for a
material matter is per se a material piece of information – even if no other
information is required.
57. The determination of metrics to be reported is informed by the assessment of
material information (‘shall include’ the information assessed to be material,
ESRS 1 paragraph 34). This is performed first at the level of the DR and
secondly at the level of the related datapoints located either in the DR3 or,
when applicable, in Application Requirements. When the information required
by a DR or a datapoint is assessed to be not material (per ESRS 1 paragraph
31), and for datapoints not needed in order to meet the objective of the
Disclosure Requirement, the undertaking ‘may omit’ such information (ESRS 1
paragraph 34).
58. The criteria to determine the materiality of information (ESRS 1 paragraph 31)
are also expected to support the determination of entity-specific disclosures
(ESRS 1 paragraph 30(b) and ESRS 1 paragraph 11 and paragraphs AR 1-5).
This ensures that entity-specific disclosures meet the qualitative characteristics
of information and include all material information.
59. The DRs and datapoints in ESRS 2 are to be reported irrespective of the
outcome of the materiality assessment. In this case, the criteria to assess the
materiality of information (ESRS 1 paragraph 31) are expected to support the
determination of the level of detail of narrative disclosure that is necessary to
meet the Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2 (ESRS 1 paragraph 31 refer to the
‘applicable information’).
2.5 Datapoints derived from EU legislation
60. When the undertaking omits a datapoint derived from other EU legislation
listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B List of datapoints in cross-cutting and topical
standards that derive from other EU legislation because it is not considered
material, the undertaking has to include an explicit statement saying that such
a datapoint is ‘not material’. ESRS 2 paragraph 56 requires that the
undertaking include in the sustainability statement a table of all the datapoints
in ESRS 2 Appendix B List of datapoints in cross-cutting and topical standards
3 For ESRS E1, this applies also for datapoints located in Application Requirements.
May 2024 Page 18 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
that derive from other EU legislation. Such table shall specify where the
datapoints can be found in the statement, and for those that are omitted as
not material, it shall report that the respective datapoint is not material. The
majority of these datapoints in Appendix B are derived from the SFDR and are
therefore used by financial market participants, who are also users of the
sustainability statement. Hence, these datapoints may be relevant for these
users and analysts.
61. These datapoints are treated similarly to other datapoints for the purposes of
assessing the information to be reported on a material matter – i.e., those
related to policies, targets and actions follow ESRS 1 paragraph 33, and those
related to metrics are omitted if not material (ESRS 1 paragraph 34).
2.6 Consideration for upstream/downstream value chain
62. The materiality assessment is also used to identify material IROs connected to
the undertaking through its direct and indirect business relationships in the
upstream and/or downstream value chain (for further details, seeIG 2 Value
Chain Implementation Guidance).
3. How is the materiality assessment performed?
63. The ESRS do not mandate how the materiality assessment process shall be
designed or conducted by an undertaking. This is because no one process
would suit all types of economic activity, organisational structure, location of
operations or upstream and downstream value chains of all undertakings
applying the ESRS.
64. Therefore, an undertaking shall design a process that is fit for these purposes
based on its specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of the
depth of the assessment, as per the requirements of ESRS 1 Chapter 3 and of
the DRs regarding the materiality assessment and its outcome (see ESRS 2 IRO-
1, IRO-2 and SBM-3). In any case, an undertaking shall consider the full scope
of environmental, social and governance matters (i.e., sustainability matters)
as listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR16 as well as any other matter that is material
from an entity-specific perspective.
65. The undertaking’s materiality assessment shall reflect both the impact and
financial materiality perspectives, as well as interconnections between the two,
but need not perform two separate and independent processes. The
identification of material impacts is generally a starting point since the financial
materiality assessment benefits from the outcome of the impact materiality
assessment (see ESRS 1 Chapter 3.3 Double materiality). The reason for this is
that material impacts trigger in most cases material risks and opportunities.
However, the undertaking shall also consider the possible matters that are
financially material only and may develop a step or a series of actions that are
specific to financial materiality. Finally, there may also be impacts deriving
from risks and opportunities and from the way that those risks and
opportunities are managed by the undertaking.
66. By way of illustration, a materiality assessment aligned with the ESRS could
follow the process outlined below, including four possible steps:
May 2024 Page 19 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(a) Step A: Understanding the context;
(b) Step B: Identification of the actual and potential IROs related to
sustainability matters;
(c) Step C: Assessment and determination of the material IROs related to
sustainability matters; and
(d) Step D: Reporting.
Figure 3. Example of a materiality assessment process
67. Chapter 5.3 FAQs on the materiality assessment process provides further
guidance, with specific FAQs on the process.
3.1 Step A: Understanding the context
68. In this step, the undertaking develops an overview of its activities and business
relationships, the context in which these take place and an understanding of
its key affected stakeholders. This overview provides key inputs to identify the
undertaking’s IROs.
Activities and business relationships
69. Activities and business relationships related to ESRS 2 SBM-1 are approached
in terms of:
(a) the analysis of the undertaking’s business plan, strategy, financial
statements and, when applicable, other information provided to
investors;
(b) the undertaking’s activities, products/services and the geographic
locations of these activities; and
May 2024 Page 20 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(c) the mapping of the undertaking’s business relationships and upstream
and/or downstream value chain, including type and nature of business
relationships.
Other contextual information
70. There are other factors that can help identify particular sources of IROs, such
as:
(a) the analysis of the undertaking’s relevant legal and regulatory
landscape; and
(b) the analysis of published documentation, such as media reports,
analysis of peers, existing sector-specific benchmarks and other
publications on general sustainability trends as well as scientific
articles.
Understanding of affected stakeholders
71. This is aimed at understanding which stakeholders are or are likely to be
affected by the undertaking’s own operations and upstream and downstream
value chain (see Chapter 3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the
materiality assessment process). It also includes their views and interests
(consistent with the disclosures per ESRS 2 SBM-2 Interests and views of
stakeholders). Based on this, the undertaking can identify its key affected
stakeholders. The following can be considered to aid such understanding:
(a) an analysis of the existing stakeholder engagement initiatives (such as
via communication, investor relations, business management, sales
and procurement teams); and
(b) a mapping of affected stakeholders across the undertaking’s activities
and business relationships. Separate groups of affected stakeholders
may be identified per activity, product or service and are to be
prioritised for a particular sustainability matter (this mapping may be
reviewed after Step B as needed).
72. Chapter 5.4 FAQ on stakeholder engagement provides further guidance on
the role of stakeholders.
3.2 Step B: Identification of the actual and potential impacts,
risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters
73. In this step, the undertaking identifies the actual and potential impacts, risks
and opportunities (IROs) relating to environmental, social and governance
matters across its own operations and in its upstream and downstream value
chain. The outcome will be a ‘long’ list of impacts, risks and opportunities for
further assessment and analysis in subsequent steps (see section 3.3).
74. The undertaking should use the list of the sustainability matters in ESRS 1
paragraph AR16 to support this process and to ensure completeness. In some
cases, it may also use the actual disclosure requirements and related
Application Requirements in the topical standards; for example, the ESRS S1-
10 metric on adequate wages and its accompanying calculation methodology
May 2024 Page 21 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
in ESRS S1 paragraph AR73 may help to assess whether the sub-subtopic
‘adequate wages’ is material. It is equally important for the undertaking to
consider entity-specific sustainability matters not covered in that list, if any.
Currently, until the sector standards are issued, sector sustainability matters
have to be identified and assessed as entity-specific matters. The available
best practices, frameworks and/or other reporting standards, such as the IFRS
industry-based guidance and GRI Sector Standards (ESRS 1 paragraph
131(b)), are possible resources to be used for the identification of entity-
specific matters, especially whilst the sector-specific standards are not issued.
75. [Draft] EFRAG IG 3 – List of ESRS Datapoints released by EFRAG is not a
checklist to identify material matters or IROs with, as it serves a different
purpose. However, it can provide a useful inventory of the range of the
sustainability matters covered by the ESRS topical standards at a more
granular level (for example, metrics) than ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16.
76. Ultimately, for each identified material IRO that is reported, the undertaking
shall disclose whether it relates to either own operations and/or upstream or
downstream value chain as well as the relevant time horizon for potential
impacts and risks and opportunities, as per ESRS 1 Chapter 6.4 Definition of
short-, medium- and long-term for reporting purposes.
Approaches
77. The process of identification of the potential matters may start with the
screening of the list of matters summarised in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 and
then be complemented with additional entity-specific matters. These may
follow from either internal processes (e.g., due diligence, risk management or
grievance mechanisms) or external sources, such as those described in
paragraph 69 above and stakeholder engagement.
78. The undertaking may also develop a ‘long’ list of impacts, risks and
opportunities relevant to its business model and upstream/downstream value
chain and aggregate them following the structure provided in ESRS 1
paragraph AR 16. The approach detailed in paragraph 75 above could be
effective for undertakings new to preparing the sustainability statement.
Alternatively, an undertaking could start from the matters as informed by
existing processes (e.g., GRI reporting or internal processes such as due
diligence and risk management). Then, the undertaking could compare the
matters identified with the list in ESRS 1 AR 16 for completeness. The two
approaches may be combined.
79. Regardless of the approach chosen to identify material sustainability matters,
the purpose is to connect them to the corresponding IROs.
80. The undertaking may aggregate or disaggregate the IROs at the most
appropriate level according to its facts and circumstances. It should relate the
names it uses (or used before ESRS implementation) for sustainability matters
when these differ from the list in ESRS 1 AR 16.
81. Chapter 5.5 FAQ on aggregation/disaggregation provides further guidance
on aggregation/disaggregation.
May 2024 Page 22 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
3.3 Step C: Assessment and determination of material IROs
related to sustainability matters
82. In this step, the undertaking applies criteria for assessing impact and financial
materiality in order to determine the material actual and potential impacts and
the material risks and opportunities. This then forms the basis for determining
material information based on the ESRS topical disclosure requirements.
83. In ESRS 1 and ESRS 2, emphasis is being placed on setting appropriate
qualitative or quantitative thresholds to assess the materiality of IROs and
related disclosures. In particular, ESRS 2 paragraphs 53 and 59 require
disclosing how these thresholds have been set or applied.
3.3.1 Impact materiality assessment
84. ESRS 1 Chapter 3.4 requires that undertakings apply objective criteria, using
appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds to assess the materiality
of actual and potential impacts. This is based on severity and, for potential
impacts, also likelihood (see Chapter 3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality –
Setting thresholds).
85. Therefore, the undertaking has to apply the criteria for severity to the list of
impacts defined in step B above. The criteria are scale, scope and irremediable
character of the impact for actual negative impacts. For potential negative
impacts, the undertaking estimates also the likelihood of the impact occurring
and maps it onto the relevant time horizon. For actual positive impacts, the
criteria are scale and scope, and for potential positive impacts, the
undertaking shall also estimate the likelihood of occurrence and map it onto
the relevant time horizon.
86. Depending on the kind of impact, it may not always be necessary to assess in
depth each of the criteria of severity, based on the undertaking’s specific facts
and circumstances, to determine whether the impact is material or not. For
example, when there is an established scientific consensus about the severity
of a particular kind of global or localised environmental impact, the
undertaking can conclude that it is indeed material without having conducted
an in-depth analysis of its scale, scope and irremediability. Therefore, the
undertaking shall exercise judgement, informed by the available evidence, to
determine what the appropriate level of the assessment of the severity criteria
is.
87. The purpose of engagement with key affected stakeholders (including
workers and their representatives) is to help the undertaking understand how
they may be impacted, and therefore, it may help the undertaking assess the
severity and likelihood of impacts4. Internal engagement with the
undertaking’s business functions and employees on the one hand and external
engagement with users of sustainability reporting and other experts on the
4 Consultation with affected stakeholders helps the undertaking understand how they may be impacted as part of
the materiality assessment (refer to ESRS 2 IRO-1 paragraph 53 (b)(iii)). The outcome of the materiality assessment
(i.e., ESRS 2 SBM 3 paragraph 48) requires the undertaking to disclose actual and potential impacts; potential
impacts are defined as impacts that are likely to affect people or the environment.
May 2024 Page 23 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
other may also help to assess, validate and ensure the completeness of the
outcome of the materiality assessment (see ESRS 1 paragraph AR8).
88. Chapter 3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the materiality assessment
process and Chapter 3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality – Setting thresholds
provide detailed guidance on the application of impact materiality criteria and
thresholds. The responses to the FAQs on impact materiality in Chapter 5.1
provide further guidance on this matter. See also Chapter 4.3 Leveraging
international instruments of due diligence.
3.3.2 Financial materiality assessment
89. Material risks and opportunities for the undertaking generally derive from
impacts, dependencies or other factors, such as exposure to climate hazards
or changes in regulation that address systemic risks. To assess their materiality,
appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds based upon financial
effects in terms of performance, financial position, cash flows and access to
and cost of capital are used.
90. Sustainability risks and opportunities are assessed based on their likelihood of
occurrence and the potential magnitude of their financial effects in the short-,
medium- and long-term. Therefore, the undertaking is required to go through
the list of potential material risks and opportunities in step B above and apply
a set of objective thresholds for likelihood and magnitude as well as consider
the nature of the effects of the identified risks and opportunities.
91. As most impacts give rise to financial risks and opportunities, the undertaking
generally will assess whether material financial effects derive from the
identified impacts (including the outcome of step B).
92. When applicable, the undertaking may compare the material risks and
opportunities per the list prepared in step B to the ones used in its risk
management process (for example, ERM5 processes). However, this is only
when the latter also covers sustainability risks. In such a case, the likelihood of
the risks and opportunities, or their related financial effects, could be
estimated accordingly.
93. It may be appropriate to engage with the undertaking’s business functions as
well as with investors of the undertaking and other financial counterparties
(e.g., banks) to assess, validate and ensure the completeness of the list of
material risks and opportunities.
94. Once a matter has been assessed to be material from a financial perspective,
the undertaking determines the information to be reported based on its
materiality (see Chapter 2.3 Criteria to determine the materiality of
information). Information is considered financially material if omitting,
misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to
influence decisions that primary users of general-purpose financial reports
take on the basis of the undertaking’s sustainability statement relating to
providing resources to the undertaking.

95. While the terms ‘risks’ and ‘opportunities’ are combined in the ESRS,
depending on the specific circumstances there are matters that trigger
exposure to risks only, others that trigger exposure to opportunities only and
others that trigger exposure to both.
96. Responses to FAQs on financial materiality in Chapter 5.2 and Chapter 3.7
Deep dive on financial materiality – Setting thresholds provide further guidance
on financial materiality.
3.3.3 Consolidating impact and financial materiality outcomes, including their
interaction
97. This step consolidates the results of the previous steps and obtains the list of
material IROs, which forms the basis for the preparation of the sustainability
statement. Analysis performed at material topic/subtopic or sub-subtopic level
is to be converted to IROs if this has not been done yet.
98. Once the undertaking has assessed individual IROs based on appropriate
thresholds and methodologies, it may aggregate the resulting IROs for
reporting purposes (refer to ESRS 1 paragraph 56). Those in charge of this
activity may also validate the aggregated double materiality results with
management to assess and validate the completeness of the list of material
IROs.
3.4 Step D: Reporting
99. Following the materiality assessment process, the undertaking shall report on
the assessment process and its outcome based on:
(a) ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess
material impacts, risks and opportunities;
(b) ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their
interaction with strategy and business model; and
(c) ESRS 2 IRO-2 Disclosure requirements in ESRS covered by the
undertaking’s sustainability statement. The undertaking shall also
disclose how it has determined the material information to be
disclosed, including thresholds and criteria used to assess such
information (ESRS 2 paragraph 59).
100. In addition, ESRS 2 GOV-2 Information provided to and sustainability matters
addressed by the undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory
(AMB) bodies includes datapoints regarding how the AMB bodies are
informed about the material impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2
paragraph 26(a) considers the IROs when overseeing the undertaking’s
strategy and risk management process and how these material IROs have
been addressed during the period. Chapter 5.6 FAQ on reporting provides
further guidance on reporting.
May 2024 Page 25 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the materiality
assessment process
101. Stakeholders are classified into the following two groups: affected
stakeholders and users of the sustainability statement6 (ESRS 1 paragraph 22).
Some, but not all, stakeholders may belong to both groups (ESRS 1 paragraph
23).
102. ESRS 2 requires transparency on the undertaking’s consultation with affected
stakeholders (IRO-1 paragraph 53 (b)(iii)). Even though the ESRS do not
mandate behaviour, the undertaking is required to disclose whether and how
the materiality assessment process identifies and assesses its impacts,
including consultation with affected stakeholders, to understand how they
may be impacted.
103. The outcome of the undertaking’s ongoing due diligence processes that are
in place is generally useful to inform the materiality assessment. However, the
ESRS do not impose due diligence processes for the purposes of reporting
only.
104. In particular, the ESRS clarify that the materiality assessment process is
informed by the due diligence process, per the international due diligence
instruments. These are the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
(MNE Guidelines) and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights (UNGPs). The engagement with affected stakeholders is central to the
undertaking’s due diligence and impact assessment (ESRS 1 paragraph 24).
The undertaking may engage with affected stakeholders or experts to provide
input or feedback on the conclusions of the materiality assessment (ESRS 1
AR 8). Such engagement may provide evidence or insights into actual or
potential impacts on people and the environment connected to the
undertaking. Social dialogue with workers’ representatives at the undertaking
level is regulated at both European Union and national levels. Under the
Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU (as amended by the CSRD), Member States
have to require undertakings to inform the workers’ representatives about
sustainability reporting and to discuss with them the relevant information and
the means of obtaining and verifying it.
105. Engagement – for example, consulting with affected stakeholders and
incorporating their views into the materiality assessment – helps to
substantiate their perspectives when determining the relevance of
sustainability matters to them. For example, this includes engaging with the
undertaking’s employees and/or their representatives on health and safety
matters. Such engagement also includes feedback received from affected
6 Stakeholders are those who can affect or be affected by the undertaking. There are two main groups of stakeholders:
(a) affected stakeholders: individuals or groups whose interests are affected or could be affected – positively or negatively – by
the undertaking’s activities and its direct and indirect business relationships across its value chain; and
(b) users of sustainability statements: primary users of general-purpose financial reporting (existing and potential investors such
as lenders and other creditors, including asset managers, credit institutions and insurance undertakings) and other users of
sustainability statements, including the undertaking’s business partners, trade unions and social partners, civil society and non-
governmental organisations, governments, analysts and academics.
May 2024 Page 26 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
stakeholders from ongoing processes of engagement as part of the
undertaking’s business practices.
106. When performing the materiality assessment, an undertaking may leverage on
its regular dialogue with affected stakeholders or may reach out to
stakeholders specifically in the context of its reporting process.
107. Dialogue with affected stakeholders may assist during various steps of the
materiality assessment. However, separate engagement with affected
stakeholders in each step of the materiality assessment is not necessary, as
undertakings may already have ongoing engagement with them to use. As
mentioned in paragraph 69 of step A, the mapping of affected stakeholders
and, where possible, prioritising them could be the first step. As part of step
B, the undertaking may engage with them or build on past or ongoing
engagement to map the impacts that they experience. Finally, in step C the
undertaking may involve affected stakeholders in the assessment of the
severity and likelihood of negative impacts that are relevant for them as well
as, for example, in the case of particularly severe impacts in validating or
providing feedback on impacts that have been assessed by the undertaking
as material (refer to ESRS 1 paragraph AR 8).
108. In situations where engagement with affected stakeholders is not possible (for
instance, because such engagement would put them at risk), the undertaking
may consider appropriate alternatives. This may include consulting credible
independent experts (ESRS S3 Affected communities), a Non-Governmental
Organisation (NGO) representing this affected community, or for
environmental matters, scientific articles and reports.
109. A source for impact materiality is scientific research, particularly for
environmental matters, where credible scientific reports and other sources
may be key to objectively assess the severity and/or likelihood of impacts.
110. Chapter 5.4 FAQ on stakeholder engagement provides further guidance on
this matter.
3.5.1 Financial materiality considerations
111. Besides the abovementioned activities on impact materiality, engagement
with users may also corroborate the evidence that supports financial
materiality of sustainability matters and help companies assess financial
materiality. The conclusions of the ESRS financial materiality assessment
should be based on supportable evidence; this may include the views and
interests of users. This is aligned with current practice for the financial
reporting materiality processes, where notes to the financial statements and
presentations to investors are adjusted regularly to reflect emerging issues
and other matters of interest to investors. To this extent, the undertaking may
leverage existing mechanisms of dialogue with shareholders, other investors
and, in some cases, lenders to support its financial materiality assessment
process.
112. In its approach to dialogue with users of sustainability information, the
undertaking may consider stakeholders other than investors who may also be
interested in general-purpose sustainability-related financial information; as
such, information may be useful to assess how the undertaking manages its
material impacts.

3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality – Setting thresholds
113. This section illustrates in more detail the methodologies or criteria that could
be used for step C on impact materiality. An undertaking shall apply the
relevant criteria using appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds
to assess the materiality of impacts connected to its activities as well as those
directly linked to its operations, products and services, including through the
upstream and downstream value chain (ESRS 1 paragraph 42 and Chapter
3.4). However, ESRS 1 does not prescribe how to set thresholds.
114. ESRS 1 Chapter 3.4 clarifies that, for actual and negative impacts, materiality is
based on the severity of the impact, while for positive impacts, materiality is
based on the scale and scope. For potential impacts, materiality also includes
consideration of their likelihood.
115. The severity of an actual or potential negative impact is assessed from the
perspective of the affected people or the environment, and it is determined
by the following characteristics that inform the basis for determining the
thresholds:
(a) Scale: how grave the impact is (i.e., extent of infringement of access to
basic life necessities or freedoms such as education, livelihood, etc.);
(b) Scope: how widespread the impact is (i.e., the number of individuals
affected or the extent of the environmental damage); and
(c) Irremediable character: the extent to which the impact can be
remediated (e.g., through compensation or restitution, whether the
people affected can be restored to their exercise of the right in
question, etc.). The underlying question is whether there are any limits
to the ability of restoring the environment or those affected to a
situation at least the same as, or equivalent to, their situation, before
the negative impact.
116. As discussed above, the undertaking may use its ongoing due diligence
processes or other risk management processes to inform its threshold-setting
and determine whether impacts are material for reporting purposes. In those
processes, the undertaking’s management of negative impacts is driven by an
analysis of severity and/or risk prioritisation, which may inform the assessment
of impact materiality.
117. When setting up thresholds, priority should be given to any supportable
evidence that provides as much objectivity as possible to the materiality
conclusion. However, reasonable quantification of the potential impacts may
not always be possible to support the materiality assessment.
118. Any of the three characteristics of severity can make an impact severe, but
often the characteristics are interdependent. Irremediable character could
impact severity by increasing its scale. In turn, it is often the case that the
greater the scale or the wider the scope of an impact, the harder it is to
remediate, albeit a case-by-case assessment is to be performed in order to
conclude if any of the three characteristics can make the impact severe.

3.6.1 Actual impacts
119. In the application of the concepts described above, by way of illustration an
undertaking could map its actual impacts onto the three characteristics of
severity in columns (figure 4) and could follow the criteria below, which is
aligned with paragraph 116 above.
120.

Please note that that the graphical representation in this figure serves only as illustration of a
possible approach to visualisation of the conclusions of assessment of impact materiality
criteria. ESRS 2 IRO-1 also requires the undertaking to explain how it determined the materiality
of the impact, including the qualitative and quantitative thresholds used.

available information. It could be
described by using general terms
(e.g., ‘unlikely’, ‘highly likely’), mathematically by using statistics terms (e.g., ‘10
in 100’, ‘10 per cent’) or by using frequency over a given time-period (e.g.,
‘once every 10 years’).
123. A similar approach to the actual impacts could be applied whereby the
threshold for reporting material impacts is defined as the red area in the
illustrative graph below. In this illustrative example, the undertaking has
assessed that high severity (scale 5) and low likelihood (scale 1) of negative
impacts are material for environmental matters; such a decision is based on
the undertaking’s judgement. Impacts with very low probability may or may
not be material depending on their severity if they occur. In the illustration
provided in Figure 5, it is assumed that an impact with the lowest level of
likelihood could be assessed to pertain to the highest level of materiality, as it
would have catastrophic environmental consequences related to
environmental hazards.

Please note that that the graphical representation in this figure serves only as
illustration of a possible approach to visualisation of the conclusions of assessment
of impact materiality criteria. ESRS 2 IRO-1 also requires the undertaking to explain
how it determined the materiality of the impact, including the qualitative and
quantitative thresholds used.
3.6.3 Consideration for groups and subsidiaries
124. ESRS 1 Chapter 7.6 Consolidated reporting and subsidiary exemptions states
that the ‘undertakings reporting at consolidated level shall ensure that all
subsidiaries are covered in a way that allows for unbiased identification of
material impacts, risks and opportunities’ (ESRS 1 paragraph 102).
125. When performing the materiality assessment at a group level, paragraph 103
does not require the adoption for a given sustainability matter of a common
threshold that is the same for the group in its entirety but rather to adopt an
approach that is at the same time consistent across the whole group and
unbiased, i.e., able to capture the specificities that may exist in a specific
subsidiary. The response to FAQ 13 describes the top-down and bottom-up
group materiality approaches. However, there is also a hybrid option whereby
the starting point is to identify those impacts that are common across the
group (for example, those related to ESRS E1 Climate change and ESRS S1
Own workforce), and then the bottom-up approach for impacts that are
specific to one or more subsidiaries are assessed using the thresholds for the
materiality assessment at group level (for more on this, refer to the
disaggregation concept referenced in ESRS 1 paragraph 104 and described
in section 3.7 Level of disaggregation).
May 2024 Page 31 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
126. The example on pollution above illustrates the interplay between materiality
at a group level and the impacts that are specific to one subsidiary and not
widespread across the group. The severity of a given impact will not change
regardless of whether there is a bottom-up or a top-down approach.
127. In a group, a matter may be assessed as material as a result of the aggregation
of several impacts derived from different subsidiaries that, if assessed in
isolation by each subsidiary, would not be considered material. This is the case
where aggregation of the impacts of the same nature across sites or
subsidiaries is feasible and meaningful (for example, for environmental
matters such as GHG emissions, emissions of pollutants or raw materials for
circular economy). In other cases, when negative human rights impacts are
occurring in the operations of just one subsidiary within a large corporate
group, because the impacts are linked to the country’s context, the impacts
may still be so severe that they meet the group materiality threshold. This is
consistent with ESRS 1 paragraph 55, which states that disaggregation by
subsidiary may be necessary (refer to FAQ 13 Performing the impact
materiality assessment when the undertaking operates in different sectors).
128. Conversely, in addition to disclosing information about matters that are
material for the group in its entirety, there may be situations where a matter is
assessed to be material for some subsidiaries in isolation but, despite the
aggregation of data of such subsidiaries, the matter is assessed as not material
for the group in its entirety. In this case following ESRS 1 paragraph 103, the
undertaking would provide information about this material matter, in order to
provide an adequate understanding of the specific impacts, risks and
opportunities of the subsidiaries concerned. In this way, despite the absence
of a reporting at subsidiary level due to the application of the subsidiary
exemption, an appropriate level of transparency is preserved where the
reporting undertaking identifies significant differences between the IROs of
the group and the IROs of one or more of its subsidiary undertakings (refer to
CSRD article 29 a, 4). This could include, next to other relevant narrative
information, metrics covering the amounts of those subsidiaries only. In this
case contextual information would be helpful, to support the understanding
that despite being material for one or more subsidiaries, the matter is not
material for the group in its entirety and of which the entities are included in
the disclosures, including in the metrics.
129. Therefore, there is no one single solution to assess the various impacts that
arise from one or more subsidiaries across the group when defining the group
thresholds and weighing the relevance of a particular subsidiary or group of
subsidiaries, as we have illustrated for environmental and social matters
above. Different methodologies and, where appropriate, aggregation
methods may be used depending on the nature of the impacts.
130. In relation to ESRS 1 paragraph 103, the significant differences between the
subsidiaries and the group are linked to the business models and the aspects
covered in ESRS 2 IRO-1 paragraph 53 (b)(i)(ii), which are activities, business
relationships, geographies and other factors. Similarly, ESRS 1 paragraph 104
clarifies that significant differences have to be assessed considering
circumstances such as different sectors and others relevant to the level of
disaggregation (ESRS 1 paragraphs 54-57), which include differences among
countries or among significant assets/sites. Hence, an undertaking that is a
May 2024 Page 32 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
conglomerate operating in different sectors with different subsidiaries in them
may not be able to identify material widespread impacts spanning across the
group but rather subsidiary-related material impacts that cannot be
aggregated at a group level. Therefore, the thresholds used in the materiality
assessment at group level are to be impartially designed to avoid excluding
these material impacts at the subsidiary level. For an investment holding
company, this would mean looking at the impacts that relate to the
investments in different sectors.
3.7 Deep dive into financial materiality – Setting thresholds
131. The ESRS do not prescribe the use of a specific threshold definition for
financial materiality. However, ESRS 1 paragraph AR 15 states: ‘Once the
undertaking has identified its risks and opportunities, it shall determine which
of them are material for reporting. This shall be based on a combination of (i)
the likelihood of occurrence and (ii) the potential magnitude of financial effects
determined in the basis of appropriate thresholds. In this step it shall consider
the contribution of those risks and opportunities to financial effects in the
short-, medium- and long-term.’
132. The undertaking may refer to absolute monetary thresholds or to relative
monetary thresholds such as a percentage of the amount corresponding to a
line item of its primary financial statements, its revenues, costs, total assets or
net equity. Similar approaches to assessing the materiality of an item for the
preparation of financial statements are in practice and may be a source of
inspiration. However, the undertaking shall consider that the time horizon for
financial materiality assessment in sustainability reporting is longer than the
typical time horizon factored in financial statements and management
commentary. This may result in the need to consider the cumulative effect of
a sustainability matter on revenues, costs, etc., over a lengthy period of time.
Similarly, a threshold for likelihood needs to consider the cumulative
probability over a period of time to cover the long-term horizon as well.
133. In this context, the materiality assessment cannot be limited to the scope of
financial effects that affect (or will affect at some point in the future) items
recognised in the financial statements. The undertaking shall also consider
financial effects associated with dependencies on natural and social resources
that do not (yet) meet the criteria for accounting recognition (ESRS 1
paragraph AR 14 and AR 15).
134. The undertaking should also consider that a sustainability matter may be
financially material despite its financial effects not being (reliably) measurable
at the reporting date. In this case, the thresholds will rely on qualitative factors
and ranges of possible effects (high/medium/low) – as in financial reporting,
where materiality is not confined to quantitative aspects, but a transaction may
be material due to its nature (i.e., qualitative approach to materiality). In
addition, it should also be noted that the phase-in disclosures for anticipated
financial effects apply as per ESRS 1 Appendix C ESRS 2 SBM-3.
135. With reference to the qualitative approach to materiality, there are
circumstances in which, depending on the sector the undertaking is active in
or the characteristics of its business model or operations, the undertaking is
exposed to reputational risks that are of interest to investors. In this case, while
May 2024 Page 33 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
an effect on cash flows cannot be quantified, the reputational risk may
influence the availability of finance and/or cost of funding and, therefore, may
be financially material.
136. When the undertaking has mechanisms of dialogue with its shareholders,
investors and lenders in place, it may leverage from this ongoing dialogue to
corroborate the determination of its materiality threshold(s) in the context of
financial materiality; The purpose is to report on information that, if omitted,
misstated or obscured, could reasonably be expected to influence the
decisions that those stakeholders make based on its sustainability statement
(ESRS 1 paragraph 48).
137. As many sustainability matters that generate material impacts are also sources
of material risks and opportunities, the undertaking shall carefully consider the
linkages in its financial materiality assessment (refer to Chapter 3 Step B and
Step C).
4. How can other sources be leveraged?
7
4.1 Leveraging the GRI Standards
138. An assessment performed under the GRI is focussed on impact materiality but
not on the financial materiality dimension, as the GRI is not based on double
materiality the way the ESRS are (see Chapter 2.1 Implementing the concept
of double materiality). However, the impact dimension is the same under GRI
Universal Standards and the ESRS even if the scope of environmental, social
and governance matters under the GRI may not be exactly the same as that of
the ESRS. Therefore, an assessment performed under GRI Universal Standards
constitutes a good basis for the assessment of impacts under the ESRS. The
financial materiality dimension is to be added when moving from the GRI
Universal Standards reporting framework to that of the ESRS.
139. Several synergies exist for undertakings that are currently reporting under the
GRI Universal Standards 2021 framework in terms of:
(a) the impact materiality assessment process: ESRS 1 Chapter 3.3, ESRS 2
IRO-1 and IRO-2 are aligned in substance with GRI Universal Standards,
and the GRI materiality assessment can be the starting point for the
ESRS double materiality assessment, with appropriate integration of
financial materiality;
(b) the universe of potential impacts identified using the GRI Universal
Standards, which are compatible in principle with the list of matters in
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 (and therefore also with ESRS architecture). In
addition, a GRI materiality assessment can inform the process of
identifying the entity-specific impacts; and
(c) the role of due diligence and stakeholder engagement, which is central
to both frameworks in informing the impact materiality assessment.
7 The content of this chapter reflects the views of EFRAG but has not been validated by the GRI or by the ISSB.
May 2024 Page 34 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
4.2 Leveraging the ISSB Standards
140. As far as EFRAG’s intentions and expectations are concerned, the criteria for
financial materiality and materiality of information in the ESRS and the
corresponding materiality approach in IFRS S1 are aligned. The following
paragraphs illustrate this alignment.
141. The financial materiality assessment in ESRS 1 corresponds to the identification
of information needed by primary users of general-purpose financial reports
when making decisions relating to the provision of resources to the
undertaking (ESRS 1 paragraph 48, aligned with IFRS S1 paragraph 1).
Between the two standards, the definition of financial materiality is aligned8.
142. Because the criteria for financial materiality in the two frameworks are aligned,
an undertaking that applies the ESRS is expected to comply with the
identification of the risks and opportunities under IFRS using the outcome of
its ESRS assessment of financial materiality. In other words, the same financial
materiality assessment process can support the identification of the risks and
opportunities for both IFRS and ESRS purposes.
143. The general criterion for assessing the materiality of information and therefore
to support the identification of the information to be reported (ESRS 1
paragraph 31) is expected, in most cases, to rely on decision-usefulness (see
Chapter 2.3 Criteria to determine the materiality of information); this is also the
criterion used in IFRS S1 to identify the information to be reported (as
material). While in the ESRS the assessment of what is decision-useful
considers both investors and other stakeholders, in IFRS this is limited to the
users’ needs for investors. However, the financial materiality dimension of the
ESRS is focused on investors and, therefore, is also aligned with IFRS S1. This
is compatible with the general principle of double materiality, as the
information dataset that serves the needs of investors (financial materiality) is
expected to be the same that fulfils the potential outside-in9 information needs
of other users (trade unions, academics, etc). The following examples illustrate
this concept.
(a) Affected communities may be interested in whether the provisions set
aside to rehabilitate polluted production sites are sufficient to cover the
necessary rehabilitation activities.
8 For both IFRS S1 and ESRS 1, information is considered material for primary users of general-purpose financial
reports if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions
that they make on the basis of the undertaking’s sustainability statement (ESRS) or the undertaking’s sustainability-
related financial disclosures and sustainability statements (IFRS S1). In addition, IFRS S1 requires to disclose
information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the
entity’s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Under ESRS 2
SBM-3, the undertaking shall disclose its material impacts, risks and opportunities. Under ESRS 1, ‘A sustainability
matter is material from a financial perspective if it generates risks or opportunities that have a material influence or
could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the undertaking’s development, financial position,
financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term’ (ESRS
1 paragraph 49). To note: IFRS S1 does not use the term ‘financial materiality’ but ‘materiality’.
9 Information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the undertaking’s development,
performance and position.
May 2024 Page 35 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(b) Current and prospective employees may want to learn about
anticipated financial effects that could impact their prospects within the
organisation (e.g., pensions or training).
144. Finally, IFRS S1 (paragraph 55) requires a reporting entity to refer to and
consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards.
Similarly, following ESRS 1 AR 4 an undertaking shall consider IFRS
Standards10 as a source of possible entity-specific disclosure. In addition, ESRS
1 transitional provisions (paragraph 131 (b)) identify IFRS sector standards as
a source of disclosure that an undertaking may use in the definition of its entity-
specific disclosures in the absence of ESRS sector-specific standards. While for
ESRS preparers the use of SASB standards is optional (as this is a possible
source of disclosure but not the only one), the provision of entity-specific
disclosure, including sector metrics, is a requirement (see ESRS 1 paragraph
11, AR 1 to AR 5).
4.3 Leveraging international instruments of due diligence
145. The materiality assessment of an undertaking’s IROs is informed by the
outcome of its due diligence process, when this is in place, as defined in the
international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (refer to
paragraph 102 of this Guidance).
146. The due diligence process includes steps to identify and assess negative
impacts caused and contributed to by the undertaking as well as those
connected to its own operations, products or services through its business
relationships. This can be particularly useful when analysing the undertaking’s
upstream and downstream value chain and when identifying the impacts
originating therein. Additionally, the due diligence instruments provide
criteria for management to prioritise actions based on the severity and
likelihood of the impacts previously identified.
147. In that sense, the due diligence process can help an undertaking both (a) to
identify its negative actual and potential impacts (see step B in Chapter 3.2)
and (b) to assess their materiality for reporting purposes based on the criteria
of severity and likelihood (see step C in Chapter 3.3.1). The identification of
material impacts also supports the identification of material sustainability risks
and opportunities, which are often a consequence of such impacts.
148. Through this due diligence process, the undertaking can also identify affected
stakeholders whose engagement informs the materiality assessment of IROs.
4.4 Leveraging other frameworks or sources
149. In addition to the other frameworks and international instruments mentioned
above, EFRAG has worked together with the TNFD to issue a mapping
between the TNFD 2024 framework and the related ESRS environmental
disclosures, namely ESRS E3-E5. For the materiality assessment, the LEAP
approach embedded within the TNFD disclosure framework may complement
and support the identification of environmental matters (refer to ESRS E2
10 SASB standards are considered to be IFRS standard-setting material.
May 2024 Page 36 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
paragraph AR 1, ESRS E3 paragraph AR 1, ESRS E4 paragraph AR 6 and ESRS
E5 AR 1).
150. Another input to use to identify IROs, along with other relevant ones in step B
of the materiality assessment process (refer to ESRS 2 paragraph AR 2), could
be the European standards approved by the European Standardisation
System (ISO/IEC or CEN/CENELEC standards), which the undertakings may
have applied (refer to ESRS 2 paragraph AR 2).
5. Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
5.1 FAQs on impact materiality
FAQ 1: Is impact materiality based on materiality for the undertaking or for
stakeholders?
151. Impact materiality is based on its impact on people or the environment, which
are in turn affected stakeholders for the undertaking.
152. The scope of impact materiality includes impacts on people and/or the
environment connected to the undertaking’s own operations and upstream
and downstream value chain, including through its products and services as
well as through its business relationships. For actual or potential impacts, the
materiality is assessed by reference to the severity of such impacts on people
and/or the environment. To assess impacts, stakeholder engagement is
central as described in FAQ 16 Do ESRS mandate to actively engage with
stakeholders?
153. In contrast, financial materiality focusses on the effects of sustainability matters
on the undertaking’s cash flows, financial performance and position, access to
finance or cost of capital in the short-, medium- or long term, as such effects
are material to the undertaking’s investors.
154. When material impacts are also associated with material risks and
opportunities, they are also material for the undertaking. However, impact
materiality is assessed based on severity on people and the environment and
not on the basis of the effects it has on the undertaking and its financial
prospects.
FAQ 2: What is meant by the undertaking being ‘connected’ to an impact?
155. As explained above, impact materiality covers impacts connected to the
undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products
and services as well as through its business relationships. An undertaking can
be connected to impacts in several ways as described below, according to the
international due diligence instruments.
156. The undertaking may be single-handedly responsible for impacts to people or
the environment if the impacts are directly caused by its operations, products
or services. Examples of such cases include:
(a) exposure of the undertaking’s own workers to hazardous working
conditions without adequate safety equipment;
May 2024 Page 37 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(b) being the sole source of pollution in a community’s drinking water
supply due to chemical effluents from its production processes; and
(c) for a positive impact, an energy producer lowering the cost of
renewable energy, allowing more customers to switch to renewable
energy, thus contributing to mitigating climate change.
157. Impacts to which the undertaking has contributed are those not caused
directly and solely by the undertaking’s operations, products, or services but
in conjunction with a third party. Therefore, any one action or omission from
the undertaking does not single-handedly cause the impact but nevertheless
does so with a third party’s actions or omissions. For example, several factories
locally release harmful emissions that are individually below harmful limits.
However, together they affect the quality of the air in the local community,
leading to a negative impact on the people and the environment.
158. Another example of contributing to an impact is when an undertaking
facilitates or incentivises another party to cause or contribute to the impact,
such as by changing requirements to suppliers repeatedly without adjusting
production deadlines and prices, thus pushing suppliers to breach labour
standards in order to deliver.
159. Impacts directly linked to the undertaking’s operations, products and
services caused by a business relationship are those in which the entity
causing or contributing to the impact is linked to the undertaking through a
business relationship. Business relationships are not limited to contractual
relationships and partners with whom the undertaking directly interacts. They
also include actors across the entire upstream/downstream value chain,
including beyond the first tier – for example, a supplier subcontracting
embroidery on clothing to child labourers, contrary to the contractual
obligations.
160. The type of involvement (i.e., caused, contribute or directly linked ) is
important given that it could lead to a different approach when addressing the
negative impacts. However, this does not imply that impacts that are directly
linked are necessarily less material than those caused or contributed to, as the
basis of the materiality assessment is severity.
FAQ 3: What are material IROs in the value chain?
161. See IG 2 FAQ 3: How should the materiality assessment process be organised
to properly capture material IROs that arise in the value chain?
FAQ 4: Can positive impacts be netted against negative impacts?
162. No – impacts are to be assessed on their own, i.e., without taking into account
other impacts. This means that positive impacts on the environment and
people cannot be netted against negative impacts.
163. This is based on the following non-exhaustive list of principles:
(a) different nature of impacts: an undertaking shall not net positive
impacts with negative impacts of a different nature (in the reporting
year or in future years). This is consistent with ESRS 1 paragraph 56:
‘… The undertaking shall not aggregate material items that differ in
May 2024 Page 38 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
nature’ as well as with the qualitative characteristics of information (QC
8 Appendix B of ESRS 1);
(b) timing of impacts: an undertaking shall not net actual negative/positive
impacts in the reporting year with positive/negative impacts of the
same nature in future years; and
(c) own operations or upstream/downstream value chain: an undertaking
shall not net impacts in own operations with impacts in the
upstream/downstream value chain.
164. Although netting and compensation/offsetting are different concepts, these
are not allowed to be considered in the assessment of impact materiality.
Specific requirements on topical standards for compensation/offsetting are
included. ESRS E1 Climate change and ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems
include specific requirements on how to report on carbon credits and
biodiversity credits for material matters.
5.2 FAQs on financial materiality
FAQ 5: Is the material information for financial statements the same as for the
sustainability statement?
165. No, it is not the same. However, the objective remains the same.
166. The financial materiality assessment of information depends on whether the
information is considered to be material for the decision-making of those who
provide, or may provide in the future, resources to the undertaking. The scope
of financial materiality for the sustainability statement is an expansion of the
scope of materiality used to determine the information to be included in the
undertaking’s financial statements (ESRS 1 paragraph 47). Whilst the concept
of materiality does not differ between ESRS and financial reporting standards,
the information that is likely to be material following the two sets of standards
does. The principles applied for the preparation of the financial statements
(under IFRS or local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs)), as
illustrated by the financial reporting conceptual framework of IFRS, clearly
delineate what should be accounted for on the basis of criteria for recognition
of assets and liabilities as well income and expenses. As a result, when defining
the thresholds for financial materiality used in the preparation of the
sustainability statement, inspiration could be drawn from criteria and
thresholds used in the preparation of the financial statements.
167. The differences between information that is likely to be financially material for
the financial statements and information that is likely to be financially material
for the sustainability statements relate to the following aspects.
(a) Sustainability reporting includes disclosures of anticipated financial
effects of material risks or opportunities that are not captured or not yet
fully captured by financial reporting at the reporting date. These could
be reasonably expected to result in financial effects for the
undertaking. Therefore, it is more likely that risks and opportunities that
are not yet material for financial statements could be material for the
sustainability statement, where there are different underlying
principles to provide information on assets and liabilities (or on
May 2024 Page 39 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
resources/opportunities and risks before they meet the accounting
definition of assets and liabilities).
(b) The information on the group is expanded in the sustainability
statement to include information about material risks and opportunities
arising from its business relationships, i.e., in the
upstream/downstream value chain. Therefore, it is more likely that
information about risks and opportunities arising from the
undertaking’s upstream/downstream value chain may be material for
the sustainability statement but not be included in the financial
statement.
(c) Potential future events may trigger current period disclosure about
anticipated sustainability-related risks and opportunities in the
sustainability statement, while financial statements typically account for
risks based upon past events. Therefore, it is more likely that forward-
looking information (such as anticipated financial effects) become
material in the sustainability statement.
(d) Time horizons may be longer in sustainability reporting as it is not
constrained by the horizons used in financial statements (such as useful
lives of assets).
FAQ 6: Is financial materiality for sustainability reporting limited to effects presented
in financial statements?
168. No – as described in FAQ 5 Is the material information for financial statements
the same as for the sustainability statements? the basis for preparation and
time horizons of financial and sustainability reporting differs. The concept of
current and anticipated financial effects defined in Annex 2 of the Delegated
Act distinguishes between:
(a) financial effects that have already crystallised and are recognised in the
primary financial statements (i.e., current financial effects); and
(b) financial effects that do not meet the recognition criteria for inclusion
in the financial statements in the reporting period (i.e., anticipated
financial effects).
169. Reporting certain financial effects associated with material sustainability
matters in the sustainability statement goes beyond what is required to be
recognised and measured in the primary financial statements and disclosed in
the notes to financial statements. In particular, financial effects that arise from
risks and opportunities are to be reported, irrespective of their accounting
treatment, when they have or could reasonably be expected to have a material
influence on the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance and
cash flows over the short-, medium- and long- term. Sustainability risks or
opportunities may derive from past or future events and may have financial
effects in relation to:
(a) assets and liabilities already recognised in financial reporting. Potential
adjustments to the carrying amount that are of interest for users of the
sustainability statement may not meet the accounting criteria for
recognition in financial statements at the reporting date albeit these
anticipated financial effects are reported in the sustainability statement,
May 2024 Page 40 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
given their relevance to users. For example, these adjustments may
include impairments that could arise as a result of a potential closure
of plants in an area of water shortage;
(b) assets, liabilities, income and expenses that may only be recognised in
financial reporting at a later stage but that are useful to users of the
sustainability statement – for example, upcoming changes in the labour
laws whereby platform workers are classified as employees with the
right to the minimum wage and other social protection benefits, and
the financial effects are reflected in future financial statements; and
(c) factors of value creation that do not meet the recognition criteria for
the financial statements but that contribute to the generation of cash
flows and the development of the undertaking. These may include
internally generated intangibles, such as human capital, that could be
described in sustainability reporting.
5.3 FAQs on the materiality assessment process
FAQ 7: How frequently should an undertaking update its sustainability materiality
assessment?
170. The CSRD defines the frequency of sustainability reporting under the ESRS as
annual given that the sustainability statement is part of the undertaking’s
management report. Accordingly, the undertaking is required to determine at
each reporting date its material impacts, risks and opportunities as well as the
material information to be included in the sustainability statement.
171. However, if the undertaking concludes based on appropriate evidence that
the outcome of the prior reporting period’s materiality assessment is still
relevant at the reporting date, the preparation of the sustainability statement
may use the conclusions previously reached. This may be true if the
undertaking assesses that there have been no material changes in its
organisational and operational structure of the undertaking and that there
have been no material changes in the external factors that could generate new
or modify existing IROs or that could impact the relevance of a specific
disclosure. Examples of changed material facts and circumstances (i.e.,
triggers) could be:
(a) a major merger and acquisition transaction leading to a new activity,
entering a new sector or a significant change in operations;
(b) a significant change of key suppliers or in the supply chain practices
(including entering in a new geographical context with significant
contextual risks, such as lack of adherence to human rights principles);
(c) a global event, such as a pandemic, or entering in a new material
business relationship that is likely to have a severe impact on human
rights;
(d) entering in a new market or starting a new line of business, or exiting
an existing market and closing an existing line of business; and
(e) a shift in social conventions, scientific evidence or users’ needs that
could affect the characteristics of severity (e.g., the level of public
May 2024 Page 41 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
scrutiny significantly increases on a matter compared to previous
periods or new studies, which provide evidence of the toxicity of a
substance).
172. The analysis performed for the preparation of the sustainability statement for
each reporting period should be sufficiently robust and proportionate to
capture possible changes from the previous period(s), including in the value
chain. The undertaking may do an annual update of its previous assessments,
focusing on the impacts, risks and opportunities that are affected by the
identified changes (e.g., as a result of the changes, some of them may cease
to be material and other material impacts risks and opportunities may arise).
173. While it is possible to perform an annual update focused on the consequences
of the identified changes, the materiality assessment is a dynamic process
subject to the inherent evolution of the undertaking and needs to be
considered for an update on an ongoing basis.
FAQ 8: May the undertaking consider only the sustainability matters in ESRS 1 AR 16?
174. No – ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 states: ‘Using this list is not a substitute for the
process of determining material matters. This list is a tool to support the
undertaking’s materiality assessment. The undertaking still needs to consider
its own specific circumstances when determining its material matters.’ Some
undertakings may have a list of material topics from previous impact
materiality assessments (for instance, GRI Universal Standards reporting) and
use the list from ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16, as described in step B of the
Materiality assessment process, Chapter 3.2.
175. The list in ESRS paragraph AR 16 is a good starting point for the identification
of sustainability matters, but it should not be used as a checklist substituting a
materiality assessment. It is an inventory of the sustainability matters covered
in the sector-agnostic topical ESRS. Sector-specific11 and entity-specific
sustainability matters (see ESRS 1 paragraph 11) should also be considered on
top of this list.
176. Given that sector-specific ESRS have not been finalised yet, sector-specific
sustainability matters shall be identified and assessed on an entity-specific
basis until the sector standards are released (see ESRS 1 paragraph 131 (b)).
11 Future sector specific ESRS will identify, where appropriate, additional sustainability matters.

of the undertaking;
(b) for a proper identification of the list of sustainability matters, as the
undertaking needs to reflect the entire time horizon (short-/medium-
/long-term) to determine whether the IRO may occur or not; and
(c) for the assessment of material matters, for which the undertaking may
consider whether the financial effects linked to a material impact may
crystalise in a different time horizon to another impact. Also, materiality
thresholds might be affected by the time horizon.
FAQ 10: Should the assessment of IROs rely on quantitative information?
179. Where possible, yes, as quantitative measures of IROs are objective evidence
of their materiality. However, it is recognised that qualitative information is
often valuable in informing the materiality assessment in its own right,
including information from affected stakeholders. Qualitative information may
provide relevant context for understanding quantitative measures.
180. The level of comfort sought by the undertaking from quantitative information
depends on whether there is scientifically validated data and on consensus
reached on the given impact. For example, global reports or industry
information on a given topic, such as negative impacts on biodiversity loss,
could provide the quantitative information needed without the need for the
undertaking to incur in additional research or data collection costs.

however, be of interest where a
topic is in between being material and non-material based on qualitative
information and/or where there are diverse views on it. In that case,
quantification could corroborate the conclusion.
183. In this context, the undertaking may adopt measures of impacts inspired by
the indicators in the Metrics and Targets section of the topical ESRS.
FAQ 11: Should the IRO dimensions of a sustainability matter be aggregated for the
materiality assessment?
184. No – even if impact and financial materiality are interrelated and the
interconnections among the two dimensions shall be considered (see ESRS 1
Chapter 3.3. Double materiality), a sustainability matter does not have to be
material from both dimensions to be regarded as material for reporting
purposes.
185. For example, an undertaking in the extractive industry has assessed health and
safety as a material negative impact due to the frequency and severity of work-
related accidents in its location. However, the current financial effects are not
considered financially material. Therefore, the impacts, risks and opportunities
on this matter are not aggregated, and the matter is regarded as material from
an impact materiality dimension only.
FAQ 12: Should the materiality assessment be documented/evidenced?
186. The ESRS do not prescribe specific documentation as this is outside its remit,
but it is reasonable to expect a certain level of documentation to be needed
for internal purposes.
187. Such documentation could inform those in charge of the governance of the
process of sustainability reporting (see ESRS 2 GOV- 2) so as to best prepare
the ESRS 2 IRO-1 disclosures and help assurance providers to perform their
work.
188. The CSRD modifies the Accounting Directive with respect to the definition of
the content of the management report in relation to sustainability information
and its digitisation (namely Art 19a and Art 29a) and has introduced mandatory
May 2024 Page 44 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
assurance of the sustainability statement (in particular, Art 34). The
documentation requirements and level of evidence to support the materiality
assessment (i.e., ESRS 2 IRO-1 and 2 as well as ESRS SBM-3) are not described
in the ESRS.
FAQ 13: Performing the impact materiality assessment when the undertaking
operates in different sectors
189. The ESRS do not prescribe a specific process for the materiality assessment as
no one process fits all undertakings, including diversified global undertakings.
190. The parent undertaking (as defined in ESRS 1 Chapter 7.6) performs its
materiality assessment for the consolidated group for the group’s material
impacts, risks and opportunities (according to CSRD Art. 29a) irrespective of
its group legal structure and of the aggregation used to prepare the
disclosures in the consolidated sustainability statement. Refer to section 3.6.3
of this implementation guidance to understand the conceptual framework and
the example offered on pollution for a subsidiary.
191. The parent undertaking may perform its materiality assessment using different
approaches or a combination of two. These two are:
(a) a top-down approach, with an assessment performed at the group
level while engaging or consulting with subsidiaries, including to
receive the necessary information; and/or
(b) a bottom-up approach, with an assessment performed at the
subsidiary level and consolidating the results at the group level.
192. An undertaking may have a variety of sustainability matters from different
subsidiaries where different levels of severity have been identified in
performing its materiality assessment at the group level. For example, it may
have a high severity impact from a small revenue stream and a medium
severity impact from its main revenue stream. Therefore, in defining thresholds
(see step C in chapter 3.3) the parent undertaking of a group operating in
different sectors has to consider an appropriate level of consistency in
methodologies when setting the appropriate thresholds across the entire
group, keeping at the same time in consideration potential differences that
exist in the exposure to impacts, risks and opportunities at the level of single
subsidiaries where appropriate. For example, in a conglomerate that operates
in different sectors, the materiality assessment conducted for each sector will
have its own peculiarities. (refer to Chapter 3.7 Deep dive into impact
materiality - Setting thresholds). Furthermore, the undertaking cannot simply
aggregate different impacts across the various subsidiaries or sectors it
operates in and apply a group threshold across all of them, as it risks obscuring
the information. In some cases, the negative impacts cannot be aggregated,
such as when they relate to high severity impacts like the violation of human
rights, which are to be considered on an individual basis, i.e., at a subsidiary
or country level (refer to ESRS 1 paragraph 103 and levels of disaggregation).
193. The undertaking should consider IROs or matters commonly associated with
its sectors, geographic locations or a specific subsidiary (see Step A in Chapter
3.1). Here, the sector standards will help in identifying the impacts, risks and
opportunities and in assessing them.
May 2024 Page 45 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
FAQ 14: Will the implementation of sector-specific standards create any new
subtopics or sub-subtopics to be considered in the materiality assessment?
194. Yes, it may. The sector-specific standards will add another layer to the sector-
agnostic standards and complement them in depth for a given subtopic/sub-
subtopic or may increase the number of subtopics/sub-subtopics.
195. Both sets of standards will have a consistent architecture. The sector-specific
standards will provide a list and description of sustainability matters common
to the sector and build on ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16.
196. As a temporary measure before the adoption of the sector-specific standards,
the undertaking may use the transitional provision related to entity-specific
disclosures (see ESRS 1 chapter 10.1). This allows undertakings to carry
forward their previous sustainability disclosures or to design additional
disclosures using best practices or other frameworks (e.g., IFRS industry-based
guidance or GRI’s) for entity-specific disclosure (per ESRS 1 paragraph 11) as
long as this information meets the qualitative characteristics of information laid
out in ESRS 1 Appendix B. The transitional provision is applicable for the first
three sustainability statements of the undertaking.
5.4 FAQs on stakeholder engagement - Impact materiality
FAQ 15: Do the ESRS mandate to actively engage in dialogue with affected
stakeholders for the materiality assessment process?
197. The ESRS require disclosure on the materiality assessment and its outcomes
but do not mandate specific behaviour on stakeholder engagement or the due
diligence process.
198. However, ESRS 1 paragraph 45 states that the impact materiality assessment
is informed by the undertaking’s due diligence process. In addition, ESRS 1
paragraph 24 points to affected stakeholders’ engagement as central to the
materiality assessment. Engagement with affected stakeholders is a tool that
supports the undertaking’s business processes (for example, due diligence) as
well as the management of sustainability matters. The undertaking, when
preparing its sustainability statement, can leverage its engagement with
affected stakeholders per its due diligence process, if applicable.
199. Stakeholder engagement informs the identification and assessment of
material impacts. This can help the assessment of severity, likelihood and time
horizons and also ensure the completeness of the material impacts identified.
Refer to Chapter 3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the materiality
assessment.
FAQ 16: Can the undertaking prioritise some categories of stakeholders for the
materiality assessment process? How?
200. Engagement with affected stakeholders helps the undertaking to understand
which sustainability matters are sources of concern for the respective
stakeholders and how they are affected. This information may be useful input
for the assessment. For further information, see Chapter 3.5 Role and
approach to stakeholders in the materiality assessment.
May 2024 Page 46 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
201. ESRS 1 paragraph 22(a) states: ‘affected stakeholders: the individuals or
groups whose interests are affected or could be affected – positively or
negatively – by the undertaking’s activities and its direct and indirect business
relationships across its value chain’. The concept of ‘key stakeholders’ (or
‘relevant stakeholders’, per international instruments) rests on the idea that not
all stakeholders will be equally affected by the undertaking’s activities.
Furthermore, the undertaking is to identify which stakeholders’ views are to be
taken into account in connection with a specific activity. It also builds upon the
idea that the degree of impact on stakeholders may inform the degree of
engagement specifically for prioritisation.
202. The undertaking may consider engaging stakeholders or their representatives
to determine whether they are affected or not if not obvious.
203. The undertaking may not engage with all the stakeholders for all sustainability
matters. Engagement with stakeholders who are not affected by the specific
sustainability matter is not meaningful. Therefore, the undertaking may
engage with different groups of affected stakeholders for different matters.
FAQ 17: What is the role of silent stakeholders and how should they be considered?
204. There may be stakeholders who cannot voice their concerns, and in the ESRS
nature has been identified as a silent stakeholder (ESRS 1 paragraph AR 7).
Nature is an essential part of the sustainability context of the undertaking and
the value chain it operates in. Nature, unlike other stakeholders, cannot voice
its concerns on its own, neither verbally nor in writing. Data from scientific
sources (e.g., scientific studies on the planetary boundaries or scientifically
validated data) may give nature a voice as it may explain the state of nature,
such as the health of bird populations, the state of water bodies or the
condition of a forest.
205. Channels monitoring the concerns of silent stakeholders can provide valuable
input to the materiality assessment for impacts, dependencies and, where
applicable, the subsequent risks and opportunities for the undertaking.
206. Examples on considering silent stakeholders could include:
(a) identifying the silent stakeholders likely to be impacted by the
undertaking’s activities and the actual and associated potential impacts
of the undertaking;
(b) research to understand the potential or actual impacts on these
stakeholders, such as reviews of scientific studies, articles and
environmental impact assessments. Such research can be at a global
level (e.g., planetary boundaries for biodiversity) or at a local level (e.g.,
via its impact on stressed water bodies or by identifying the type of
species impacted);
(c) using proxies such as organisations that are legitimate representatives
of, or that are considered by the undertaking to appropriately
represent, the silent stakeholder. For considerations about nature, the
undertaking may consider organisations that assess the current and
future state of the ecosystem, water resources or climate; and
May 2024 Page 47 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
(d) testing the results of the estimated potential impacts based on experts’
consultation, collaborative partnership with NGOs and other
stakeholders.
5.5 FAQs on aggregation/disaggregation
FAQ 18: Does the undertaking use the same criteria when defining the level of
disaggregation across all IROs?
207. No – the disaggregation for materiality purposes of the material impacts
should fairly reflect the severity of actual impacts or the severity and likelihood
of potential impacts and it may be different across the various material
impacts. For risks and opportunities, it should reflect the magnitude of current
financial effects, while for anticipated financial effects it should reflect the
magnitude and likelihood. The principle is to avoid obscuring the specificity
and context necessary to interpret the information and to avoid the
aggregation of material items of a different nature. This is set out in ESRS 1
paragraph 54: ‘When needed for a proper understanding of its material
impacts, risks and opportunities, the undertaking shall disaggregate the
reported information:
(a) by country, when there are significant variations of material impacts,
risks and opportunities across countries and when presenting the
information at a higher level of aggregation (for instance, region)
would obscure material information about impacts, risks or
opportunities; or
(b) by significant site or by significant asset, when material impacts, risks
and opportunities are highly dependent on a specific location or asset
rather than presenting the information at a higher level of aggregation
(for instance, countries).’
208. ESRS 1 paragraph 55 clarifies that in defining the approach to disaggregation
of reported information the undertaking shall, for consistency reasons,
consider the approach adopted for materiality assessment.

FAQ 19: Is an IFRS or local GAAP segment an appropriate level of disaggregation for
the materiality assessment?
212. In general, no – the goals of the disaggregation objectives for financial
reporting and sustainability reporting are different (also refer to FAQ 5: Is the
material information for financial statements the same as for the sustainability
statement? and FAQ 6: Is financial materiality for sustainability reporting
limited to effects presented in financial statements?). In general, the sector
classification of the undertaking’s activities is more appropriate as a starting
point (refer to ESRS 2 IRO-1 paragraph 53(b)(i)).
213. Segment reporting under IFRS is based on a ‘management approach’ (as
explained in the Basis for Conclusions for ESRS 2). Local GAAP may be based
on the same or a different approach for segment reporting. The core principle
of IFRS 8 Segment Reporting is to require disclosures to enable users of the
financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
activities of the undertaking as well as the economic environments in which it
operates (IFRS 8 paragraph 1). The level of disaggregation or reportable

5.6 FAQs on reporting
FAQ 20: Do the ESRS require disclosure of severity for material impacts as well as
likelihood and magnitude for material risks and opportunities?
216. The ESRS do not require disclosure of the detailed outcome per each criterion;
however, an appropriate explanation of criteria and thresholds used shall be
included. The undertaking shall report on the processes to identify and assess
material IROs, as required by ESRS 2 IRO-1, and on the outcome, as required
by ESRS 2 SBM-3 and IRO-2. ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48(g) requires
disclosure on changes to the material IROs since the prior year. For instance,
on impact materiality the scale and irremediable character of a particular
negative impact could have been assessed as high in the current period versus
medium in the prior year and thus become material and in need of disclosure.
217. As explained in FAQ 12 Should the materiality assessment be
documented/evidenced? the ESRS do not prescribe specific documentation;
however, it is reasonable to expect that a certain level of documentation will
12 ESRS 1 SBM-1 requires the identification of the ESRS sectors in which the undertaking operates (ESRS 2
paragraph (b) and (c)) and requires disclosure of the revenues by ESRS sectors. According to the work
programme approved by the EFRAG SRB on 11 October 2023, EFRAG will consult in the last quarter of 2024 on a
proposed ESRS sector classification. However, the undertaking has to determine the necessary level of
disaggregation of its disclosure following Chapter 3.7 of ESRS 1 and cannot assume that the ESRS sector
disaggregation is appropriate for all the disclosures.
May 2024 Page 50 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
be produced. This could be used for internal purposes and for the assurance
providers of the undertaking’s sustainability statement.
218. Such documentation can also include a description of severity (including scale,
scope and irremediable character) and likelihood of material impacts as well
as likelihood of occurrence and potential magnitude of material risks and
opportunities. This documentation can help the undertaking’s management
and the assurance provider (i.e., as audit evidence) to better understand the
materiality assessment process and the related results.
FAQ 21: If a matter is material from the financial (or impact) perspective only, shall
disclosures cover all the requirements or only information about the relevant
perspective?
219. The determination of information to be reported for metrics is informed by the
assessment of the materiality of information (refer to Chapter 2.3 Criteria for
the determination of the materiality of information). Hence, if a matter is
material due to its impacts and there are no material risks and opportunities
arising from the same matter, information disclosed on metrics shall be limited
to metrics that are relevant under the impact materiality perspective, and the
datapoints related to the risks and opportunities or financial effects are to be
omitted13 (ESRS 1 paragraphs 31 and 34).
220. When a matter is assessed to be material from a financial (or impact)
perspective only, the information about policies, actions and targets shall
cover all the datapoints in the minimum disclosure requirements14 and the
topical standards (ESRS 1 paragraph 33). The level of detail of such information
will reflect the general approach to information materiality (ESRS 1 paragraph
31) The undertaking will describe the content of policies, actions and targets
in place connected to the sustainability matters that are material from the
impact or financial perspectives or both, according to the materiality
assessment.
221. It is also important to note that disclosure that informs about actual or potential
impacts is of interest for investors when a matter is financially material.
Similarly, financial information is also relevant for stakeholders other than
investors when a matter is material from the impact perspective as it supports
accountability.
FAQ 22: Is a multi-sector group required to include metrics for the entire group or
only data related to the material IROs?
222. Once metrics have been assessed for materiality and determined to be
material, the data for the entire group shall be included in the metrics. This is
not the case where specified differently in sector-agnostic topical or sector-
specific standards (refer to the example below).
13 A datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement in metrics may be omitted when the corresponding information is
assessed to be not material provided that the omitted information is not needed to meet the objective of the
Disclosure Requirement (ESRS 1 paragraph 34).
14 See ESRS 2 Chapter 4.2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements on policies and actions and Minimum Disclosure
Requirements on targets in Chapter 5 Metrics and targets.

225. Disclosure regarding IRO management related to policies, actions and targets
will reflect the extent of the activities within the group that are covered by
those policies, actions and targets. As such, they may only cover the ‘problem
area’ of the material IRO when appropriate. Likewise, for entity-specific metrics
the metric could be focussed on the parts of the group where such material
IROs arise.
226. Finally, the ESRS stipulate for the level of disaggregation that, ‘when needed
for a proper understanding of its material IROs, the undertaking shall
disaggregate the reported information …’ (ESRS 1 paragraph 54).
227. In addition to disclosing information about matters that are material for the
group in its entirety, there may be situations where a matter is assessed to be
material for some subsidiaries in isolation but, despite the aggregation of data
of such subsidiaries, the matter is assessed as not material for the group in its
entirety. In this case following paragraph 103 of ESRS 1, the undertaking would
May 2024 Page 52 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
provide information about this material matter, in order to provide an
adequate understanding of the specific impacts, risks and opportunities of the
subsidiaries concerned. In this way, despite the absence of a reporting at
subsidiary level due to the application of the subsidiary exemption, an
appropriate level of transparency is preserved where the reporting
undertaking identifies significant differences between the IROs of the group
and the IROs of one or more of its subsidiary undertakings (refer to CSRD article
29 a, 4). This could include, next to other relevant narrative information,
metrics covering the amounts of those subsidiaries only. In this case contextual
information would be helpful, to support the understanding that despite being
material for one or more subsidiaries, the matter is not material for the group
in its entirety and the undertaking, as well as to disclose which entities are
included in the disclosures, including in the metrics.
FAQ 23: Are remediation and mitigation actions considered in the materiality
assessment of environmental impacts?
228. As a general principle, environmental impacts are considered before any
mitigating actions in the materiality assessment. This is linked to the objective
of providing information on the management of impacts by the undertaking
over time, and it is mirrored in the ESRS architecture as follows for the potential
impacts.
(a) The description of the impacts before taking into account remediation,
prevention or mitigation actions is the basis for the materiality
assessment process and its related disclosures (namely, ESRS 2 IRO-1
and SBM-3).
(b) The management of such impacts – including remediation, prevention
and mitigation actions – is part of the policies, actions and targets (i.e.,
MDR-P, MDR-A and MDR-T).
(c) The users of the sustainability statement will obtain an understanding
of the unmitigated impacts connected to the undertaking and how the
undertaking is addressing those – that is, an understanding of the
impacts after remediation, mitigation and prevention.
229. Differentiating between actual impacts (i.e., those that have happened or are
ongoing in the reporting period) and potential impacts (i.e., those that have a
likelihood of occurrence in the short-, medium- or long-term) is relevant, and
the illustrations below develop these concepts.
Actual impacts
230. The undertaking is expected to assess the actual impacts that have taken place
in the current or previous reporting period(s). The severity of the impact,
assessed for the current reporting period, depends on successful mitigation
that has taken place before or during the event. This is further illustrated as
follows.
(a) For an accident occurred in the current year, such as an oil spill or the
failure of an emission treatment facility and subsequent pollution-
related impacts, the undertaking is expected to consider these events
in its materiality assessment when identifying actual impacts. Any
remediation or rehabilitation activities put in place after the event but
May 2024 Page 53 of 55
EFRAG IG 1: Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidance
in the same period are not taken into account in the materiality
assessment. Likewise, mitigation actions that the undertaking may carry
out in the future are not taken into account in the materiality
assessment. On the contrary, mitigation activities, such as pollution
containment or immediate stopping of operations that were put in
place before and during the incident, are considered when assessing
the severity of the actual impact as they either worked or did not work
to mitigate the impact or its severity.
(b) For material negative impacts that occurred in the past, these are
expected to be considered in the materiality assessment as well as
whether they are still considered material in the current reporting
period. In the example of the oil spill, the aquatic and coastal
ecosystems may be materially negatively affected by the oil pollution
for many years and remain in the materiality assessment for a number
of years.
Potential impacts
231. The undertaking is expected to assess its potential impacts and disclose those
that are material. These potential impacts relate to both the existing
operations and the planned operations; an example for planned operations is
the construction of a new factory or a new production line in an existing factory.
232. The example below illustrates the preceding paragraphs.
(a) If a chemical producer plans to introduce a new production process
using a hazardous substance without any available wastewater
treatment technique, at the time of preparing the assessment it cannot
assume in its materiality assessment that such a technique will be
available in the future and neglect the potential impact.
233. Whilst similar concepts and questions apply to social impacts, guidance
covering social impacts may be issued in the future to better reflect specific
aspects of those matters.
FAQ 24: Shall the undertaking also report on material matters where there are no
actions?
234. Yes – the materiality assessment is

5.7 FAQ on Art. 8 EU Taxonomy
FAQ 25: What is the relationship between taxonomy eligible activities and
materiality?
236. The EU Taxonomy Regulation and its Delegated Acts define criteria for a
number of economic activities (eligible activities) that need to be fulfilled in
order to substantially contribute to one of six environmental objectives. In
addition, these activities must do no significant harm (DNSH) to the other
environmental objectives and fulfil minimum social safeguards to be
considered taxonomy aligned. The environmental objectives of the Taxonomy
Regulation are fully reflected in the environmental topics covered by the ESRS.
If an undertaking engages in activities that are eligible for the EU Taxonomy,
this indicates that it impacts the environmental objective for which the
Taxonomy defines substantial contribution (SC). To this extent, the following
information can be an input to the materiality assessment when identifying
IROs (i.e., refer to Chapter 3.2 Step B of this Guidance):
(a) whether the undertaking has in place activities that do or do not comply
with the criteria for substantial contribution, including Capex plans; and
(b) whether these activities comply or not with one or more of the DNSH
criteria.
237. Despite the relationship between the Art. 8 Taxonomy and ESRS, taxonomy-
eligibility is no precedent for the ESRS materiality assessment. Reporting
taxonomy-eligible activities by an undertaking neither oblige companies to
assess those as material nor to explain that they are not. The Art. 8 Taxonomy
is a process that can inform the materiality assessment; other processes that
can also inform it are due diligence and the enterprise risk management.
