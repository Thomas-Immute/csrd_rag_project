Objective and structure of this [draft] standard
1. Consistent with ESRS 1 paragraph 10, the objective of this [draft] ESRS is to specify
disclosure and application requirements that enable users of sustainability statements to
understand material impacts, risks and opportunities, that are likely to be material for all
undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by
topical standards. This [draft] ESRS covers the sustainability matters that are most relevant
to the Mining, Quarrying and Coal sector.
2. This [draft] ESRS specifies disclosure and application requirements as follows:
(a) additional sector-specific datapoints and/or application requirements related to sector-
agnostic disclosure requirements. Additional datapoints are located in the main body
of this standard and additional Application Requirements are located in Appendix B. In
both cases, they are identified by having in their title the requirement of sector-agnostic
ESRS to which they relate (e.g. ESRS2.IRO2.MQC).
(b) sector-specific Disclosure Requirements are presented in the main body of this [draft]
standard and are identified by a progressive numbering (MQC 1, MQC 2, etc.). Their
respective Application Requirements are presented in Appendix B.
3. The requirements classified in this [draft] standard as policies, actions and targets are
subject to the materiality provisions of paragraph 33 of ESRS 1. Those classified as metrics
are subject to the materiality provisions of paragraph 34 of ESRS 1. When assessing
additional sector-specific datapoints in this [draft] standard referred to in paragraph 2 (a)
above for condition of paragraph 34 (b) of ESRS 1, the undertaking shall refer to the objective
of the relevant Disclosure Requirement in the sector agnostic standards.
3.1. The requirements of this standard shall be applied in conjunction with SEC1 that specifies
specifying general sector requirements and disclosure which are applicable to all sectors.

Appendix A: Defined terms
This appendix is an integral part of this Exposure Draft and has the same authority as the other parts
of this Exposure Draft.
Acid drainage (including Highly acidic, polluted water containing free sulphuric acid and
acid rock drainage and dissolved metals sulphate salts resulting from the oxidation of
acid mine drainage) contained sulphide minerals or additives to the process.
Acid drainage can result from a variety of natural sources and
anthropogenic activities.
In the case of acid rock drainage (ARD), this oxidation process
occurs naturally and is complemented by reactions of the base
minerals in the rock, which are exposed to air and water.
For acid mine drainage (AMD), this is a common form of water
pollution in areas where mining took place. It is the result of open-
pit underground extraction operations (in particular mining and coal
mining) and extractive waste facilities, causing an acceleration of
the acid draining process because such activities increase the
exposure of sulphide minerals to air, water, and microorganisms.
Conflict-affected and high- Areas in a state of armed conflict or fragile post-conflict as well as
risk areas areas witnessing weak or non-existent governance and security,
such as failed states, and widespread and systematic violations of
international law, including human rights abuses.
Environmental defenders
The term "environmental defenders” refers to individuals and
groups who, in their personal or professional capacity and in a
peaceful manner, strive to protect and promote human rights
relating to the environment, including water, air, land, flora and
fauna. Land and environmental rights are interlinked and are often
inseparable. As a result, the two broad categories of defenders
advocating for the environment and for land rights are often
characterized as “land and environmental rights defenders”,
“environmental rights defenders”, or just “environmental activists”.
Flaring Flaring means the controlled combustion of coal mine methane for
the purposes of reducing the global warming potential of methane
and minimizing mine hazards associated with methane.
Human rights defender
The term “human rights defenders” refers to individuals, groups and
organs of society that promote and protect universally recognised
human rights and fundamental freedoms. Human rights defenders
seek the promotion and protection of civil and political rights as well
as the promotion, protection and realisation of economic, social and
cultural rights. Human rights defenders also promote and protect
the rights of members of groups such as indigenous communities.
The definition does not include those individuals or groups who
commit or propagate violence.
Infrastructure Facilities built primarily to provide a public service or good rather
than a commercial purpose, and from which an organization does
not seek to gain direct economic benefit.
Migrant worker A person who is to be engaged, is engaged or has been engaged
in a remunerated activity in a state of which they are not nationals.
Mineral probable reserves Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed
from information similar to that used for proven (measured)
reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement
are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
EFRAG SRB 16 October 2024 Page 21 of 54
Mineral proven reserves Mineral proven reserves are estimated quantities that analyses of
geological and engineering data have demonstrated to be
economically recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
and under current economic conditions, operating methods, and
government regulations.
Normal operation (or Regularly oscillating activity phases that support continued
normal operating operation within safe upper and lower operating limits. It is also the
conditions) condition or phase of process operation between the startup phase
and shutdown phase, other than start-up (e.g., bringing an activity,
an equipment item or a tank into or out of service), shutdown (i.e.,
definitive cessation of operations), or emergency operations (e.g.,
leaks, malfunctions, momentary stoppages).
Occupational health Services entrusted with essentially preventive functions, and
services responsible for advising the employer, the workers, and their
representatives in the undertaking, on the requirements for
establishing and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment,
which will facilitate optimal physical and mental health in relation to
work and the adaptation of work to the capabilities of workers in the
light of their state of physical and mental health
Other water Surface water that is not fresh water, and water from other sources.
Surface water Surface water, including rainwater, water from wetlands, rivers and
lakes. Water that is naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface
in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers
and streams, and has a low concentration of dissolved solids.
Spills Spills are accidental release of hazardous substances such as
chemicals, oils, fuels and other substances. They can affect water,
soil and air quality as well as biodiversity and human health.
Tailings and tailings Tailings are a by-product of mining, consisting of fine-grained waste
facilities solids or slurries that remain after the treatment of metals and
minerals recoverable (left over rock or soil) have been extracted by
separation processes (e.g. crushing, grinding, size-sorting, flotation
and other physico‐chemical techniques) to remove the valuable
minerals from the less valuable rock.
Tailings facilities are part of a business site and encompass the
whole set of structures required for the handling of tailings including
the tailings storage facility (used to contain tailings produced by
mines, such as decant structures and spillways, open pits, dry
stacking, lakes or underground storages), tailings dams
(embankments and impoundment structures, ponds designed to
enable the tailings to settle and to retain tailings and process
water), delivery pipelines, etc. Tailings facilities store large amounts
of mining waste.
EFRAG SRB 16 October 2024 Page 22 of 54
Appendix B: Application Requirements
This Appendix is an integral part of the proposed [draft] ESRS Mining, Quarrying and Coal and has the
same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
AR 1. This sector standard introduce two cross-cutting sustainability matters which play a role in the
undertaking’s materiality assessment:
(a) The mining, quarrying and coal activities are highly prone to incidents and accidents with
disastrous impacts on environmental resources (extreme contamination of air, water and
soil), surrounding communities and infrastructures (e.g., damage to economic activities
and food resources), workers (e.g., injuries, ill health, fatalities), as well as undertaking’s
assets, leading to critical financial repercussions. Some examples of industrial hazards
include ground or strata failure, fires or explosions, inundation or inrush of any substance
(including from tailings dam failures), leaks of poisonous gases, spills of hazardous
chemicals or slurry. Specifically, underground mining can generate dust explosions,
inundation, mining corridor collapses or others. Open pit mining can cause landslides,
water inbursts, machinery failures and others
(b) closure of assets, which refer to ceasing of the operations, whenever site-specific
extractive operations such as those in oil and gas are subject to closure due to finite
resources and/or economic viability. At the end-of-life of an operation, the expectation is
that the site will be restored to pre-development ecological functionality and setting or at
least stabilized to prevent persistent environmental and social impact associated with
geomorphological changes, increased contamination, and deteriorated safety conditions.
Decommissioning planning, including financial allocation, is critical to ensure detrimental
effects to environmental and social values are fully addressed and mitigated. As such,
corporate financial disclosure for decommissioning is essential to demonstrate public
accountability for businesses in the extractives sector. The term asset in this definition
does not relate to resources that would meet the financial accounting definition of asset.
(c) tailings management is unarguably the most substantial and riskiest issue in the industry
due to the large amounts of processing metals and chemicals (e.g., cyanide) involved that
may be released and the proportions of the areas covered by the facilities and, hence, the
disastrous consequences on nature (e.g., surface and ground water) and human health
(e.g., local communities) that can stem from tailings facilities collapses and failure.
AR 2. Whenever a cross-cutting sustainability matter is identified, the likelihood of occurrence for
number of other sustainability matters is increasing, as illustrated in the table below. Upon the
conclusion of materiality of cross-cutting sustainability matters, the undertaking shall evaluate the
connected sustainability matters.

Appendix F: Description of sustainability matters
This Appendix complements the [draft] ESRS Mining, Quarrying and Coal and presents a non-binding
description of the sustainability matters that are most relevant for undertakings in the Oil and Gas sector.
For the sustainability matters that are also listed in paragraph AR16 of ESRS 1, this Appendix provides
a description of how such matters materialise in this specific sector.
Industrial hazards
The mining, quarrying and coal activities are highly prone to incidents and accidents with disastrous
impacts on environmental resources (extreme contamination of air, water and soil), surrounding
communities and infrastructures (e.g., damage to economic activities and food resources), workers
(e.g., injuries, ill health, fatalities), as well as undertaking’s assets, leading to critical financial
repercussions. Some examples of industrial hazards include ground or strata failure, fires or explosions,
inundation or inrush of any substance (including from tailings dam failures), leaks of poisonous gases,
spills of hazardous chemicals or slurry. Specifically, underground mining can generate dust explosions,
inundation, mining corridor collapses or others. Open pit mining can cause landslides, water inbursts,
machinery failures and others. Such hazards may result in emissions of toxic gases and vapours,
rockfalls, flooding and extreme temperatures. The establishment of a system and a culture of safety,
including through emergency preparedness and control, may help undertakings to reduce the risk of
such hazards.
Closure of assets
Site-specific extractive operations such as those in mining, quarrying and coal are subject to closure
due to finite resources and/or economic viability. At the end-of-life of an operation, the expectation is
that the site will be restored to pre-development ecological functionality and setting or at least stabilized
to prevent persistent environmental and social impact associated with geomorphological changes,
increased contamination, and deteriorated safety conditions. Decommissioning planning, including
financial allocation, is critical to ensure detrimental effects to environmental and social values are fully
addressed and mitigated. As such, corporate financial disclosure for decommissioning is essential to
demonstrate public accountability for businesses in the extractives sector. The term asset in this
definition does not relate to resources that would meet the financial accounting definition of asset.
Tailings
Tailings are a by-product of mining, consisting of fine-grained waste solids or slurries that remain after
the treatment of metals and minerals recoverable (left over rock or soil) have been extracted by
separation processes (e.g. crushing, grinding, size-sorting, flotation and other physico‐chemical
techniques) to remove the valuable minerals from the less valuable rock. The handling of tailings is
done through tailings facilities, which include tailings storage facilities (used to contain tailings produced
by mines, such as decant structures and spillways, open pits, dry stacking, lakes or underground
storages), tailings dams (embankments and impoundment structures, ponds designed to enable the
tailings to settle and to retain tailings and process water), delivery pipelines, etc. Tailings facilities store
large amounts of mining waste, containing toxic substances that may spread out to the surroundings,
causing chronic and acute negative impacts to the environment and human health. Therefore, the
management of tailings (during operation, closure and post-closure), is fundamental and considered to
be the long-term responsibility of mining, quarrying and coal companies.
E1: Climate change adaptation
The sector is exposed to a range of risk from the current and future climate variability. Those may
include, for example, increasing cost of natural resources, extreme weather events causing damage to
the infrastructure, water availability decrease, increased dust emissions. Moreover, the impacts of
climate change can cause significant disruption in the supply chain of the industry also contributing to
create more dangerous working conditions for employee due to extreme weather events. Thorough risk
evaluation and assessment as well as working towards resilience across the whole value chain,
including surrounding communities and infrastructure, are essential to manage risk and opportunities
related to the matters of climate change adaptation.
E1: Climate change mitigation
Mining operations generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including CO from
2
fuel use during mining, ore processing, and smelting activities. The GHG intensity may increase with
decreasing grades of deposits and increasing depth and scale of mining operations. It will also depend
on the method used (open pit or underground mining, excavation type, depth of the mine), volumes of
fugitive methane released, or the type of metal mined and processed. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG
emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result in additional regulatory
compliance costs and risks for metals and mining undertakings due to climate change mitigation
policies.
Coal operations generate significant amounts of CO emissions and have the highest intensity per
2
energy unit out of all fossil fuels. For coal operations the release of GHG emissions includes CO from
2
fuel use and methane released from coal beds during mining and post-mining activities. Mitigating
climate change can include changes in the developing of activities to reduce emissions and the effect
these changes may have on the undertaking’s employees and the communities in which coal activities
take place.
E1: Energy
Mining, quarrying and coal operations are often energy-intensive. Currently, diesel is the most common
source of energy consumption, especially for the usage of large mining equipment. The use of
alternative sources such as liquefied or compressed natural gas, electricity or even hydrogen, is also
possible (especially for smaller equipment) even if not immediately considered a more efficient
alternative. A significant proportion of energy consumption in the sector is, anyway, accounted for by
purchased electricity (which is often not coming from sustainable sources). Decisions about use of
alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity (versus purchases from the
grid) can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable,
easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with purchased
fuels and electricity accounting for a significant proportion of total production costs. In order to be
effective, decisions on the aspects related to alternative fuels should be adequately integrated in the
design and business model of mining operations, especially considering the increasing demand
expected in future years.
E1: Methane
Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. It is produced during
coal formation and remains trapped in the coal deposits, being prone to release during activities related
to coal mining. Underground coal mine operators use ventilation and degasification systems to remove
methane from the mine and further handle it through venting, flaring, as well as other management
methods. Surface mines can also face methane releases from coal deposits disturbed by blasting
operations. Methane releases can occur in operational mines, as well unactive and abandoned mines.
These emissions can be significantly reduced through the use of available technologies and dedicated
leak detection and repair programs.
E2: Pollution of air
Mining and quarrying operations can give rise to various hazardous air pollutants from smelting and
refining activities, and use of explosives to uncover the reserves, with quarrying making extensive use
of dynamite to blast rock aiding the excavation. The use of explosives may result in emissions such as
dust, vibrations, gaseous byproducts or flyrock. Coal operations are often associated with air emissions
from drilling, refining to the transportation, waste management and active mine fires. Significant air
pollutants in these three subsectors are sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide
(CO), particulate matter (PM), heavy metals (particularly lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic),
persistent organic pollutants (POPs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as several types of
dust particles. Exposed surfaces of extractive waste primarily result in dust and VOCs releases.
E2: Pollution of water
Mining (e.g., excavation), quarrying (e.g., nitro-glycerine spills) and coal (e.g., coal washing to remove
sulphur, cooling drilling equipment, transporting coal in slurry pipelines) processing extensively use
water, resulting in surface water and groundwater contamination through erosion and sedimentation
(e.g., suspended solids generation), tailings leakage and exposure to highly sulphidic excavated waste
rock (e.g., acid mine drainage). These types of water quality concerns may accelerate further
acidification and contamination over time, increasing the leaching of heavy metals (arsenic, cobalt,
copper, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc), leading to impacts that persist for decades after closure. Deep-
sea mining is another critical issue of concern causing pollution in water columns from excessive light,
noise, wastewater discharges, and sediment plumes.
E2: Pollution of soil
Soil pollution is a critical issue stemming from mining, quarrying and coal activities, given that the
resulting pollutants can be retained by soil for a long time and slowly be passed to other media (water,
air). Site soils and soils in their proximity, including in post-mining locations, have great variability in
their properties (e.g., physical structure degradation due to dust accumulation, significant imbalances
of pH levels due to different explosives used, toxic elements versus nutritional content) as a
consequence of the leaching of waste rock and tailings produced at all stages of operation (e.g., ore
and metallurgical extraction, ore beneficiation). Tailings are usually highly acidic and sandy with low
levels of nutrients and their depositing on the ground may lead to severe soil fertility and integrity issues
or sedimentation of massive amounts of heavy metals on the topsoil.
E2: Substances of concern and substances of very high concern
Mining (including coal mining) and quarrying operations (e.g., blasting, separation of minerals from ores,
creation of tunnels) widely use substances with high chemical hazards. These lead to chronic and
devastating effects on the environment (e.g., high toxicity in marine ecosystems) and human health
(e.g., respiratory infections, cardiac and neuromuscular effects) as they are dumped on the surface,
spilled from sites or leached due to precipitations, and spread to surrounding areas. The most
concerning substances in this sector include mercury (a recognized volatile, persistent heavy metal of
global concern), cyanide (life-threatening, fast-acting poison), sulphuric acids (leading to chronic
inflammation and irritation), explosive (releasing toxic gases such as nitric and nitrogen oxides, as well
as carbon monoxides), silica dust (hazardous to lungs and carcinogenic), and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (acute toxicity to birds and aquatic organisms).
E2: Pollution of living organisms and food resources
Mining, coal and quarrying operations (including through deep-sea mining resulting in sediment plumes,
sea floor compaction, diminishing algae biomass through metal oxide deposition, etc.) may directly
cause disturbances in the reproduction and growth of animals (e.g., benthic fauna), organisms and
plants, up to the destruction of wildlife altogether (e.g., through sediment generation and). For instance,
heavy metals concentrations in site surrounding can be absorbed by crops and soil organisms, hence
bioaccumulating in plant fibres and inhibiting enzyme functions. Arsenic might pollute food resources,
with high negative impacts on neurotoxicity arising after consumption. Acid mine drainage, for instance
raises the risks of degrading the quality of water to the point of exterminating wildlife due to its persistent
nature. An excess in the generation of sediments may suffocate watershed vegetation and organisms.
Suspended solids deplete oxygen levels and light diffusion and raise temperatures.
E3: Water use, including water withdrawals and water consumption
Mining, quarrying and coal operations can impact both the availability and the quality of local water
resources considering the substantial volumes of water required for the production process. Mining
operations, depending on their geographical and geological location, must manage water consumption,
flood risks, water quality and other issues. Undertakings that are unable to secure a stable water supply
could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs.
Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower
operating risks and costs for undertakings by minimizing the impact of regulations, water supply
shortages, and community-related disruptions on the operations of the undertaking. In dry climates, an
undertaking may need to focus more on conservation, collecting, storing, and reusing contact water
from the tailing’s storage facility, seepage, open pit, and/or underground mine. For wet climates the
greatest challenge is rather managing flood events and eliminating the risks of spilling, erosion, and
infrastructure failure. Undertakings in cold climate regions must consider the large quantity of water
generated from snow melt and ice thaw and manage the impacts of permafrost on drainage facilities.
E3: Water discharges in water bodies and in the oceans
Mining, quarrying and coal operations may discharge used water into water bodies or waterways. These
discharges eventually can end up leading to a range of impacts described under pollution sustainability
matters (chemical pollution, eutrophication of water bodies). This in return affects or poisons organisms
living in the water, and it can cause negative effects on humans through fishing in these waters or
tourism that depends on the existence of clean water bodies to attract customers. Recycling and
cleaning processes of water discharges can allow to reuse much of the water used on a site, thereby
decreasing operational dependency on an already scarce commodity. Clean water discharge will also
avoid the risks for wildlife and human health or recreational activities.
E3: Habitat degradation and intensity of pressure on marine resources
Mining and coal activities can produce large volumes of waste, formed by the non-processed rock from
overburden or access tunnels and shafts, and by the processed tailings. Traditionally, tailings are stored
in land dams, but the lack of land availability, potential risk of dam failure, geological instability, and
topography in coastal areas in certain countries makes consideration of disposal of tailings into marine
systems, a process usually known as Deep-Sea Tailings Disposal. DSTD can have lasting impacts on
biodiversity, ocean ecosystems as well as on fishing communities. Moreover, some undertakings are
currently exploring deep-sea bed mining, which can be associated with a risks to the marine
environment.
E4: Impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems
The entire life cycle of Mining, quarrying and coal projects, namely, development, operation, closure
and restoration of mine and quarries sites, can have direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on
biodiversity and condition of ecosystems, both in the short and long term. The development phase, in
particular, typically requires large-scale infrastructure developments that have impacts on biodiversity,
namely the alteration of landscapes, vegetation removal, and impacts to wildlife habitats. During the
operation phase, pollution is a particularly significant risk to biodiversity and condition of ecosystems
acid drainage is a particularly significant risk: it is highly acidic water, rich in heavy metals, formed when
surface and shallow subsurface water encounter mining overburden. Acid drainage can have harmful
effects on humans, animals, and plants. Similarly, tailings management will play an important role.
Quarries are often operated close to processing facilities and require the removal of vegetation and
topsoil and the blasting and crushing of underlying stone deposits. This process can lead to permanent
alterations of the landscape, with associated impacts on biodiversity. The environmental characteristics
of the land where quarrying takes place could increase extraction costs, due to increasing awareness
and protection of ecosystems. The use and spill of nitro-glycerine also may affect groundwater or
surface water as well as the animals living in it.
Mining activities can have impacts on biodiversity beyond the mine site. These impacts can be more
significant when mining occurs in or near ecologically sensitive areas. For example, mining activities
can spread into ecological corridors and disrupt the functioning of an ecologically sensitive area.
Inactive mine pits, underground workings, and hazardous waste can also cause biodiversity impacts
beyond closure (see also topic 14.8 Closure and rehabilitation)
Biodiversity impacts from coal activities include contamination of air, soil, and water; deforestation; soil
erosion; and sedimentation of waterways. Other impacts can include animal mortality or increased
vulnerability to predators, habitat fragmentation and conversion, and the introduction of invasive species
and pathogens.
E4: Direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss
Mining, quarrying and coal operations make substantial impacts on the earth and nature around them.
Surface mining and mountaintop removal can alter the landscape, removing vegetation and wildlife
habitats. Acid mine drainage is particularly significant: it is highly acidic water, rich in heavy metals,
formed when surface and shallow subsurface water encounters mining overburden, and can have
harmful effects on humans, animals, and plants. Similarly, tailings management will play an important
role. Biodiversity impacts of coal operations can affect the valuation of reserves and create operational
risks. The environmental characteristics of the land where operational sites are located could increase
extraction costs as a result of increasing awareness and protection of ecosystems. undertakings could
also face regulatory or reputational barriers to accessing reserves in ecologically sensitive areas, such
as the designation of areas where reserves are located as protected areas. Undertakings face
regulatory risks related to reclamation after a mine is decommissioned, per applicable regulatory
requirements to restore mined property according to a prior, approved reclamation plan. Material costs
may arise from removing or covering refuse piles, fulfilling water treatment obligations, and dismantling
infrastructure at the end of life. Furthermore, ongoing operations are subject to laws protecting
endangered species.
Direct drivers of biodiversity loss influence biodiversity and ecosystem processes, leading to impacts
such as degradation of ecosystems, habitat fragmentation, and animal mortality. Mining activities may
contribute to the direct drivers of biodiversity loss through land and sea use change, for example, in the
form of land clearance for mining, access routes, and waste management facilities; exploitation of
natural resources by withdrawing and consuming water; through the introduction of invasive alien
species; and pollution. Sources of air, water, and soil pollution can include:
E4: Impacts on the state of species
Mining, quarrying and coal operations can cause impacts which affect the continued existence of
species not only because of indirect effects such as pollution but also because operational sites are
located at or nearby areas where species have their natural habitat. The disappearance of one or more
species can result in the disappearance of an entire ecosystem of species that depend on each other.
E4: Impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services
Mining, quarrying and coal operations can impact ecosystem services (the benefits to humans provided
by the natural environment and healthy ecosystems). The disturbance of habitats by different kinds of
pollution related to the operations, excavation activities in itself or deforestation prior to it affects the
possibility of natural ecosystems to provide ecosystem services. Mining, quarrying and coal operations
also can interact with human and social capital by disconnecting areas supplying ecosystem services
from the people that rely on them.
Mining activities typically require large-scale developments that have impacts on biodiversity and
ecosystem services. These impacts can limit the availability and accessibility of natural resources or
degrade their quality. Impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services may also affect the well-being
and livelihoods of local communities and Indigenous Peoples (see also topic 14.10 Local communities
and 14.11 Rights of Indigenous Peoples).
E5: Resources inflows, including resource use
Mining activities are highly reliant on the extraction of critical raw materials and rare earths, which are
fundamental to the EU’s welfare and economy as they represent the input to produce many goods that
are massively consumed. The present and future demand for metals and non-metal materials is, hence,
growing with the increase of the demand of consumer goods, and the need to secure supply of these
materials (which is finite). Their recovery, however, can also cause severe disruption to ecosystems as
well as environmental contamination.
E5: Waste
The mining activities generate large volumes of mineral processing wastes, including slags and tailings,
some of which may be hazardous or chemically reactive. Impoundments for tailings can cover large
areas of land. Mineral waste is often stored in-pit, using abandoned open pit surface mines. Some
mining activities can take place in coastal or deep-sea ecosystems, which can result in pollution of
marine ecosystems if the waste processing is not accordingly managed. Coal activities can include
handling of solid rock and clay waste, process refuse, and liquid coal waste containing hazardous
substances like mercury, arsenic, and cadmium posing operational and regulatory challenges for coal
operations undertakings.
S1/S2: Working time and work-life balance
Mining, quarrying and coal operations are typically operated in a manner that involves irregular working
hours for a large portion of their own workforces. Mines and coal operations are frequently operated
around-the-clock, including on weekends. Shift work longer than eight hours, and evening, night and
weekend work are typical for many workers in this sector. Furthermore, mining and coal operations
located far away from populated areas (“remote locations”) often resort to arrangements whereby
workers will rotate between long multi-day or multi-week periods on site and periods with time off off-
site (“fly-in fly-out” arrangements). In such remote locations adequate housing, access to water and
sanitation and health care are often material matters.
Research has demonstrated an association between extensive irregular working hours and time without
family, recreation, and leisure and negative impacts on physical and psychological health and work-life
balance. Extensive use of irregular working hours may make it difficult for undertakings to retain their
workers and recruit new workers.
S1/S2: Health and safety
Mining, quarrying and coal operations may result in both strenuous and dangerous working conditions
and are associated with a high degree of risk related to safety matters. Injuries may be caused by
accidents with heavy equipment or explosives or collapse of mines or other facilities. Workers’ health
may be impaired by prolonged exposure to dust, heat, vibration, noise, ultraviolet light, heavy lifting and
repetitive movements, and hazardous chemicals. This sector has higher than average rates of fatalities,
injuries, lost workdays and occupational diseases. Worker injuries, illnesses, and fatalities can lead to
regulatory penalties, negative publicity, low worker morale and productivity, and increased healthcare
and compensation costs.This sustainability matter covers the undertaking’s policies regarding health
and safety, critical incident risk management, as well as workforce health, wellbeing, and safety
S1/S2: Adequate wages and secure employment
Many undertakings in the mining, coal and quarry sector make extensive use of non-employee workers,
typically referred to as ‘contractors’ - that is, self-employed workers contracting directly with the
undertaking or supplied by employment agencies. Many of these workers are utilized for extended
periods of time for regular operations and perform work which is the same or similar to the work that
employees do. However, these workers lack the employment security and, frequently, the wages and
benefits that employees receive. Generally, non-employees may be exposed to higher risk of injury and
heath impairment and may have fewer rights to unemployment and early retirement benefits and access
to retraining than employees when it comes to the closure of mine sites, which can be also related to
unemployment problems for the local community.
Another factor contributing to the materiality of these matters is the extensive contracting-out of the
operation of mining, quarrying and coal operations. Contracting-out rather than owner-operator
arrangements are particularly frequent in the case of smaller owners (‘junior miners’), who may have
little or no experience in operating a mine. Contracting-out arrangements have relevance for the security
of employment, since such arrangements typically are medium term (e.g. five years) and obligations to
the contractors’ workforce as a rule do not extent beyond the end of the contract.
These are also material issues in the mining sector given the amount of artisanal and small-scale mining
within the industry who, due to their small scale, don't have the governance structure and protection in
place to ensure their worker’s rights.
S1/S2: Freedom of association and collective bargaining
The mining, quarrying and coal sector in many countries has a higher rate of trade union representation
and collective bargaining coverage than the economy-wide national average. However, freedom of
association may be at risk, particularly in locations where these are not guaranteed by national
legislation and/or where enforcement is weak. Many mining and coal operations are located in countries
where the rule of law has broken down (10 of the 148 countries rated in the 2022 ITUC Rights Index),
where labour rights are not guaranteed (34 countries) or where there are systematic violations of labour
rights (39 countries). The proportion of self-employed workers (‘contractors’) whose working conditions
are determined by a collective bargaining agreement (the ‘collective bargaining coverage rate’) is
typically lower than that of employees.
S1: Training and skills development
Mining, quarrying and coal operations can be both technically difficult and dangerous and it is therefore
imperative that the workers are properly trained and have the skills and capabilities to handle the risks
that working in the mine entails. Health and safety-related training, including the proper use of
equipment and handling of explosives and hazardous chemicals, is key to reduce the risk of accidents
and occupational diseases. Some mining, coal and quarrying operations are placed in the middle or
close to active conflict areas. They may also be the subject of controversy which leads to the necessity
of security personnel. Thus, this sustainability matter also includes training of security personnel in
human rights and humanitarian law.
S1: Measures against violence and harassment in the workplace
The remoteness and relative isolation of mining sites and housing camps make women more vulnerable
to gender-based violence in the workplace, in comparison with other sectors. The male domination of
the industry also contributes to this problem. Negative publicity on this issue can have a negative impact
on the reputation of specific undertakings as well as on the industry as a whole and can make it more
difficult to retain existing and recruit new female workers. Measures against violence and harassment
at the workplace include clear policies on these issues, workforce training and an effective grievance
mechanism in place.
S1: Diversity, including gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value
The mining, coal and quarrying industry has been identified as one of the most highly male-dominated
industries, with few women employed and an above-average male-female wage gaps. Research
reports that many female workers in the industry feel that they do not receive the same level of support
and have the same career chances as their male colleagues. One impact of this situation is that many
female workers will be earning less money and not realizing their full career potential. Another possible
impact is on local communities, particularly where the undertaking is the main employer, as fewer
women will benefit from income and career chances. It also may contribute to the difficulties to recruit
workers as women (who make up half of the labour force) may be reluctant to work in the sector.
Racism, which results in demotivated workers and a negative workplace culture, has also been reported
to be an issue in the industry, with many of the same impacts on minorities that gender discrimination
has on women. Ensuring workforce inclusion, diversity, and that minorities have equal opportunities is
therefore an important aspect of sustainability within the mining industry. Such measures include clearly
communicated policies, effective grievance and remediation mechanisms, clear criteria and procedures
for remuneration and promotion, mentoring and other forms of support.
S1/S2: Child labour
The ILO estimates that one million children are working in mining and quarries. The use of child labour
is most prevalent in countries where labour rights are weak and/or poorly enforced and in artisanal and
small-scale mining suppliers. In addition to the negative impact child labour can have on the health,
development and well-being of children, there is reputational risk for undertakings using child labour in
own operations or in the supply chain. This sustainability matter therefore includes the undertaking's
efforts to tackle these risks, the organization's supply chain management and whether it ensures that it
is ethical, sustainable, and ensures protection of the rights of all their suppliers' employees. The OECD
has issued sector-specific guidelines on due diligence in mining, and the ILO has developed
recommendations for action plans to address child labour in this sector.
S1/S2: Forced labour
The ILO estimates that roughly a quarter million adults are subject to forced labour in mining, as well
as a significant proportion of the one million children working in the sector. As in the case of child labour,
forced labour is concentrated in certain countries where labour rights are weak and in artisanal and
small-scale mining suppliers.
This sustainability matter therefore includes the undertaking's efforts to tackle these risks, the
organization's supply chain management and whether it ensures that it is ethical, sustainable, and
ensures protection of the rights of all their suppliers' employees. The ILO, OECD, IOM and UNICEF
have jointly issued recommendations for ending child labour, forced labour and human trafficking in
global supply chains.
S1/S2: Adequate housing, including water and sanitation (Mining and coal only)
Adequate housing, including water and sanitation, is a material issue where mining, quarrying and coal
operations are located in remote areas or in communities lacking the housing and other infrastructure
needed to fully support the workforce. The quality of housing includes not only the physical condition of
the housing structure but also the physical and social environment in which the housing is located. In
some case of remote locations, infrastructure is completely lacking and workers may be flown in for
weeks at a time. Housing currently provided by undertakings ranges from temporary camps to
dormitories to homes. In these situations, the quality of this housing and the suitability of this housing
for families, is a material issue. Policies, targets and action plans on this matter focus on the quality of
housing that is provided to workers. Basic measures of housing quality used in the EU include access
to water and sanitation, adequacy of heating, the absence of a leaking roof, and adequate space (i.e.
lack of overcrowding).
S3: Infrastructure. Including adequate housing, adequate food, water and sanitation and power.
Mining and coal operations are interlinked with the location and communities in which these take place.
This affects the employment and economic performance in the area, as well as potentially exposing the
local community to hazardous substances if operations are not handled with the proper care. Due to
impact on the local communities, this sustainability matter includes, but is not limited to; the living
infrastructures of the local communities; its economic impacts; the communities’ access to adequate
food, the operations land-related impacts, their impact on families, children, and community as a whole;
smell, light, noise, and vibration pollution; access to water and sanitation.
S3: Impacts on land rights
Mining and coal are land-intensive sectors, whose impacts can materialize when land is acquired to
develop a project, but also when environmental pollution, ongoing deforestation, access restrictions
among others, further impede the capacity of indigenous and local communities to access, cultivate
lands or benefit from forests.
S3: Security-related impacts
Mining and coal operations can be located in or near areas of active conflict or could become a source
of local conflict. They therefore can have an impact on the security and potential conflicts in the area.
S3: Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly
Due to the presence of mining and coal operations in countries where the enforcement of human rights
may be low, there is a higher risk for violations of the civil and political rights among the undertaking’s
employees and local communities. This sustainability matter includes, but is not limited to, freedom of
expression and freedom of assembly.
S3: Impacts on environmental and human rights defenders
The mining industry is one of the most closely watched sectors in terms of human rights protection and
environmental defenders with several hundred attacks globally in addition to the concrete risk of threats
and abuse. Ensuring the rights and protection of human rights and environmental defenders is therefore
of the utmost importance in the mining industry.
S3: Particular rights of indigenous communities, including free, prior and informed consent;
self-determination; and cultural rights
Mining and coal operations often take place in locations that are in close proximity to indigenous
communities, and consequently have an impact on these communities due to its economic influence
and the environmental consequences from these operations. Examples can be found in disputes and
conflicts over land ownerships and absence of good faith in consultation; also the potential influx of
workers from other areas can result in discrimination toward indigenous peoples regarding access to jobs
and opportunities that can further undermine social cohesion, well-being and safety or the increased
exposure of indigenous women to risks of prostitution, forced labour or violence. This sustainability matter
would therefore cover if there has been a free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous people and
the practice the undertaking has in place to ensure his. It also includes whether land-use rights, the
right to self-determination as well as cultural right has been respected and indigenous communities’
access to water is guaranteed.
G1: Corporate culture (Code of conduct and ethics)
Ensuring that undertakings have a code of conduct and ethics that outlines how the undertaking and its
employees are expected to conduct themselves to guarantee security and guidance in their everyday
work. Mining and coal operations are in locations all over the world, and it is therefore important that
undertakings within the sector have a clearly stated code of conduct to ensure that the rights of
employees and members of local communities are protected by the organization with no regard to the
location of the operations.
G1: Corruption and bribery
Due to the nature of mining operations, along with other extractive industries, the mining and coal sector
has a high risk for corruption and bribery events as their value chains are complex and of high value.
This may lead to an undertaking taking advantage which consequently damages the environment and
has a negative impact on the well-being of employees and local communities. This sustainability matter
does not only include the efforts carried by an organization to guarantee that these actions are not
happening within it, but also the measures implemented to prevent this from occurring. It also covers
the consequences of a breach of policy, potential reprimands for breaches and the whistle blowing
systems and protections the undertaking has in place.
G1: Political engagement and lobbying activities
Mining and coal operations, along with other extractive industries, are often important sectors within a
country industry and therefore have wide ranging impacts on the communities and countries they
operate within. This leads to them often engaging in politics and lobbying activities regarding legislation
and political decisions. When democratic safeguards are not strong, political engagement and lobbying
activities can result in less consideration of the interest of the local community. Only when both the
interests of the undertaking and the interests of the local community are upheld there can be an effective
and value creating operation.
G1: Management of relationships (including payment practices)
Managing relationships with governments, business partners, suppliers and stakeholders is of vital
importance for undertakings in the mining industry. Stakeholder engagement can prevent, monitor, and
help mitigate any environmental or social risks. For this reason, stakeholder engagement shall be
integrated into project planning and regular business operations through sharing of decision-making
power with interested and affected parties and it shall be driven by stakeholders through ongoing
consultation and follow-through. As per OECD guidelines on stakeholder engagement in the extractive
industries, stakeholder engagement strategies shall prioritise engagement with most severely affected
stakeholders, rather than most influential stakeholders. This includes, but is not limited to, artisanal and
small-scale miners and civil society organizations. Clarity and transparency regarding payments to
governments from undertakings in the mining industry sector will contribute to a more efficient
management of public funds and avoiding corruption. Such payments may be the origin of revenue for
local communities and other regions, which may have increased demand for public spending. Project-
level payment data is therefore relevant information to local communities, governments, and investors
alike. It enables undertakings to demonstrate the economic contribution they are making in relation to
specific projects, and the communities they affect.
G1: Protection of natural resources
Due to the value and nature of the natural resources exploited under mining contracts and licenses
and/or contracts where such resources are purchased from the state, it means that there are significant
opportunities to enrich individuals while the local community does not receive the full value that it should.
These are further described below:
Licenses and contracts: As explained by EITI (The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative),
contracts, licenses and associated agreements are important elements as they explain the rights and
obligations of all parties involved in the exploration and production of oil, gas and minerals.
Contract transparency can help curb corruption and empower citizens to assess whether they are
getting a good deal for their resources as it informs on the terms that govern extractive projects,
including revenues to national and subnational governments. This information can be crucial in contexts
where precious revenues are impacted by market volatility and emerging energy transition policies.
Commodity trading: Per EITI, sometimes, extractive companies pay governments for the right to extract
resources with in-kind payments of oil, gas and minerals. The state or the state-owned enterprise (SOE)
then sells these physical resources to commodity trading companies or domestic refineries. Commodity
traders may also provide resource-backed loans to governments or state-owned companies in
exchange for future production of commodities.
These are so significant, that almost half of total government revenues reported through the EITI come
from the sale of oil, gas and minerals to commodity trading companies. The scale and significance of
these payments make them a matter of public interest.
Without transparency over the terms of these transactions, commodity trading is vulnerable to
corruption and can jeopardise public revenues. Commodity trading transparency ensures that all parties
understand the terms on which trades take place and how these may affect the funds available for
public expenditures and development.
Beneficial ownership: The real owners of extractive companies, known as the beneficial owners, are
often kept anonymous or hidden by a chain of shell companies. This can be a particular challenge in
the extractive industries, where knowing who has the rights to extract oil, gas and minerals is key to
addressing risks of corruption or conflict of interest.
Protecting anonymity can deter investment and make it harder to curb corruption. It is estimated that
developing countries have lost USD 1 trillion a year since 2011 as a result of corrupt or illegal deals, many
of which involve anonymous companies. Investigations using beneficial ownership information
culminated in data leaks such as the Panama Papers, the Luanda Leaks and the Pandora Papers.
Publishing details of company ownership can help close channels for corruption, enable effective
taxation, build fairer markets, encourage responsible investment and manage business risk. Addressing
these issues will remain critical as the energy transition gathers pace.
