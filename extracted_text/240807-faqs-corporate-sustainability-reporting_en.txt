DRAFT COMMISSION NOTICE
on the interpretation of certain legal provisions in Directive 2013/34/EU (Accounting
Directive), Directive 2006/43/EC (Audit Directive), Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 (Audit
Regulation), Directive 2004/109/EC (Transparency Directive), Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 (first set of European Sustainability Reporting Standards
“first ESRS delegated act”), and Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (Sustainable Finance
Disclosures Regulation “SFDR”) as regards sustainability reporting
This set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) clarifies the interpretation of certain
provisions on sustainability reporting introduced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive “CSRD” (Directive (EU) 2022/2464)) into the Accounting Directive (Directive
2013/34/EU), the Audit Directive (Directive 2006/43/EC), the Audit Regulation (Regulation
(EU) No 537/2014), and the Transparency Directive (Directive 2004/109/EC) with the aim of
facilitating their implementation by undertakings. It also clarifies certain provisions of the
Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation “SFDR” (Regulation (EU) 2019/2088).
This set of FAQs also includes a limited number of clarifications concerning the
interpretation of certain provisions of the first set of European Sustainability Reporting
Standards “ESRS” (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772), where legal
interpretation from the Commission has been deemed to be necessary. Undertakings and
other stakeholders may also wish to consult the implementation guidance on ESRS published
by EFRAG, the multistakeholder advisory body tasked with advising the Commission on
ESRS.1
Through this set of FAQs, the Commission intends to facilitate the compliance of
stakeholders with the regulatory requirements in a cost-effective way and to ensure the
usability and comparability of the reported information on sustainability. By providing
greater clarity and certainty to companies, this set of FAQs will contribute to the
Commission's objective of reducing administrative burdens on undertakings associated with
sustainability reporting2. The Commission may update these FAQs where appropriate.
The replies to the FAQs contained in this Notice clarify the provisions already contained in
the applicable legislation. They do not extend in any way the rights and obligations deriving
from such legislation nor introduce any additional requirements. These FAQs are merely
intended to assist undertakings in the implementation of the relevant legal provisions. Only
the Court of Justice of the European Union is competent to authoritatively interpret Union
law. The views expressed in this Notice cannot prejudge the position that the Commission
might take before the Union and national courts.
1 www.efrag.org EFRAG has published implementation guidance on materiality assessment, on value-chain
reporting and on the list of datapoints contained in ESRS. EFRAG is currently developing implementation
guidance on climate transition plans. In addition, EFRAG has established an online Q&A platform through
which undertakings and other stakeholders can submit technical questions on ESRS.
2 In order to rationalise reporting obligations, the Commission has made full use of its empowerment in Article
3(13) Accounting Directive to adopt Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2023/2775 of 17 October 2023
amending Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L, 2023/2775, 21.12.2023)
to adjust the size criteria applicable to the definition micro, small, medium-sized and large undertakings or
groups for the effects of inflation. This has reduced the number of undertakings subject to sustainability
reporting requirements under the Accounting Directive – and, consequently, under Article 8 of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation).

Transparency Directive Directive 2004/109/EC15.
Section II – Overview of the sustainability reporting requirements introduced by the
CSRD
The CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive - Directive (EU) 2022/2464) has
introduced new sustainability reporting requirements for certain undertakings by way of
amendments to the Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU), Audit Directive (Directive
2006/43/EC), Audit Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 537/2014), and Transparency Directive
(Directive 2004/109/EC).
Overall16, these sustainability reporting requirements oblige certain undertakings to publish
sustainability information, which must be prepared in accordance with specific sustainability
reporting standards and, where applicable, comply with a digital format. This sustainability
information is subject to an assurance requirement and must be published together with the
related assurance report.
Overall, these sustainability reporting requirements apply to undertakings governed by the
law of a Member State17 that are:
− large undertakings;
− SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading
on an EU regulated market; and
− parent undertakings of large groups.
They also apply to undertakings governed by the law of a third country that have either
transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market (excluding micro-
undertakings) or that have business in the territory of the Union above certain thresholds18.
The rules to determine the size of an undertaking and the scope of consolidation for
sustainability reporting purposes rely on the existing rules for financial reporting purposes,
which are set out in the national measures transposing the pre-existing Accounting Directive.
The Accounting Directive thresholds for the determination of the size of each category of
undertaking are indicated in the box within the “Flowchart to identify the applicable
sustainability reporting requirements and the application date” below.
The date of application of these sustainability reporting requirements varies depending on the
specific reporting requirement and on the category of undertaking. The specific application
date for each requirement is indicated in the paragraph “Sustainability requirements for
reporting undertakings” below.
14 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the
establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088
(Text with EEA relevance) (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).
15 Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the
harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are
admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC (OJ L 390, 31.12.2004, p. 38).
16 This is an overview of the main sustainability reporting requirements. Relevant reporting requirements for
undertakings governed by the law of a Member State: Articles 19a, 29a, 40a Accounting Directive. For a more
detailed illustration of each requirement, please see the paragraphs below.
17 This is an overview of the undertakings in the scope of these sustainability reporting requirements. For a more
detailed illustration of the undertakings in the scope of each requirement, please see the paragraphs below.
18 Relevant reporting requirements for undertakings governed by the law of a third country: Article 4(5)
Transparency Directive (which cross-refers to Articles 19a and 29a Accounting Directive) and Article 40a
Accounting Directive.
5
As these requirements are introduced by way of a Directive, the specific rules that apply to
undertakings are the ones set out in the national legislation transposing the Accounting
Directive as amended by the CSRD19, as well as by Commission Delegated Directive (EU)
2023/277520 that has adjusted the size criteria applicable to the definition of micro, small,
medium-sized and large undertakings or groups for the effects of inflation, therefore reducing
the number of undertakings subject to sustainability and, to a certain extent, financial
reporting requirements.
The CSRD does not regulate the voluntary disclosure of sustainability information by
undertakings that do not fall under the scope of CSRD (for instance, SMEs without securities
admitted to trading on an EU regulated market), which is not subject to mandatory
requirements at Union level.
SUSTAINABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING UNDERTAKINGS
1. Preparation, assurance and publication of the sustainability information to be
reported under Articles 19a and 29a Accounting Directive (sustainability statement)
1.1 Sustainability information to be reported at individual level under Article 19a
Accounting Directive (sustainability statement)
Based on Article 19a Accounting Directive, undertakings governed by the law of a
Member State that are:
− large undertakings21; or
− SMEs22, excluding micro-undertakings23, with transferable securities24 admitted
to trading on an EU regulated market;
must report sustainability information at individual level (individual sustainability
statement) concerning the undertaking’s impacts on sustainability matters, and
concerning how sustainability matters affect the undertaking’s development,
performance and position.
The individual sustainability statement must comply with the following requirements:
(i) it must be included in a dedicated section of the undertaking’s management
report;
19 The rules on the presentation and the content of the sustainability statement prepared by undertakings are set
out in the delegated acts specifying the relevant European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). These
standards are adopted by way of Regulations, therefore are directly applicable by undertakings without need for
Member States to transpose them.
20 Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2023/2775 of 17 October 2023 amending Directive 2013/34/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council as regards the adjustments of the size criteria for micro, small, medium-
sized and large undertakings or groups (OJ L, 2023/2775, 21.12.2023).

Standards (ESRS) adopted by way of Commission delegated acts25. SMEs
(excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading on
an EU regulated market may alternatively prepare their individual sustainability
statement in accordance with a dedicated set of proportionate ESRS26 adopted by
way of Commission delegated acts (LSME ESRS)27;
(iii) it must be marked-up in accordance with a digital taxonomy28 adopted by way of
an amendment to Commission Delegated Regulation on the European Single
Electronic Format (ESEF)29, and the management report that includes the
sustainability statement shall be prepared in the XHTML format30;
(iv) it must be subject to assurance31, to be carried out by statutory auditors, or
Independent Assurance Services Providers “IASPs” where allowed by a Member
State, based on limited assurance standards32;
(v) the management report that includes the sustainability statement shall be

year;
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025 (i.e. with publication in
2026): the other large undertakings (i.e. large undertakings which are not “public-
interest entities exceeding on their balance sheet dates the average number of
500 employees during the financial year”);
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2026 (i.e. with publication in
2027):

been adopted by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772) and the sector-specific ESRS (to be
adopted by the Commission by 30 June 2026).
26 Article 19a(6) Accounting Directive.
27 Article 29c Accounting Directive.
28 A “digital taxonomy” is a set of rules (which will be adopted by way of an amendment to Commission
Delegated Regulation 2019/815) that will set out how to mark-up the information within the sustainability
statement - which has to be included in a management report drawn-up in XHTML format - in order for the
sustainability statement to become machine-readable.
29 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/815 of 17 December 2018 supplementing Directive
2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the
specification of a single electronic reporting format (OJ L 143, 29.5.2019, p. 1).

32 Based on Article 26a of the CSRD, the assurance of sustainability reporting must be carried out in compliance
with the limited assurance standards to be adopted by the Commission by 1 October 2026 (and currently under
development). Member States may however apply national assurance standards, procedures or requirements as
long as the Commission has not adopted an assurance standard covering the same subject matter.
33 The sustainability reporting requirements set out in the Accounting Directive as amended by the CSRD do not
modify the pre-existing publication deadline for the management report specified in Article 30 of the
Accounting Directive, i.e. at the latest 12 months after the balance sheet date.

• SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable securities
admitted to trading on an EU regulated market;
• small and non-complex institutions37 provided they are either large
undertakings or SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market;
• captive insurance undertakings38 and captive reinsurance undertakings39
provided that they are either large undertakings or SMEs (excluding
micro-undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading on an
EU regulated market.
SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading
on an EU regulated market may opt-out from these requirements until financial years
beginning before 1 January 2028, provided that they briefly state in their
management report why the sustainability reporting was not provided40.
The undertaking is exempted from the obligation to publish an individual
sustainability statement where the information is included in the consolidated
sustainability statement of a parent undertaking, provided that certain conditions are
met as regards the content of the exempted undertaking’s management report and the
publication of the sustainability information by the parent undertaking41. Large
undertakings with securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market –
including small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and
captive reinsurance undertakings and including third-country undertakings - cannot
avail of this exemption42.
1.2 Sustainability information to be reported at consolidated level under Article 29a
Accounting Directive (consolidated sustainability statement)
Based on Article 29a Accounting Directive, an undertaking governed by the law of a
Member State that is a parent undertaking of a large group43 must report sustainability
information at consolidated level (consolidated sustainability statement) concerning
the undertaking’s impacts on sustainability matters, and concerning how sustainability
matters affect the undertaking’s development, performance and position.
The consolidated sustainability statement must comply with the same requirements
specified for the individual sustainability statement (paragraph 1.1 above, points (i) to
(v))44.
These requirements must be complied with based on the following phased approach45:
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024 (i.e. for publication in
2025): public-interest entities that are parent undertakings of a large group
37 Defined in point (145) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
38 Defined in point (2) of Article 13 of Directive 2009/138/EC.
39 Defined in point (5) of Article 13 of Directive 2009/138/EC.

41 These conditions are set out in Article 19a(9) Accounting Directive. See also FAQ 19.
42 Article 19a(10) Accounting Directive.
43 As defined in Article 3(7) Accounting Directive.
44 However, the consolidated sustainability statement can only be prepared using ESRS. Parent undertakings of
large groups that are SMEs with transferable securities admitted to trading on the EU regulated markets may not
use LSME ESRS.
45 Article 5(2) first subparagraph Accounting Directive.

exceeding on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, an average number
of 500 employees during the financial year;
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025 (i.e. with publication in
2026): the other parent undertakings of a large group (i.e. parent undertakings of
a large group that are not “public-interest entities and/or whose group does not
exceed on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, an average number of
500 employees during the financial year”).
A parent undertaking that publishes a consolidated sustainability statement is exempt
from the obligation to publish its individual sustainability statement46. A parent
undertaking that is also a subsidiary undertaking is exempt from publishing a
consolidated sustainability statement where the information is included in the
consolidated sustainability statement or consolidated sustainability reporting of
another parent undertaking, provided that certain conditions are met as regards the
content of the exempted undertaking’s management report and the publication of the
sustainability information by the parent undertaking47. Large undertakings with
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market – including small and non-
complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance
undertakings and including third-country undertakings - cannot avail of this
exemption48.
1.3 Sustainability information to be reported at individual level (sustainability statement)
or - for parent undertakings of large groups - at consolidated level (consolidated
sustainability statement) under Article 4(5) of the Transparency Directive by issuers
of transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market)
Based on Article 4(5) of the Transparency Directive, which cross-refers to Articles
19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive, issuers of transferable securities admitted to
trading on an EU regulated market49 (regardless of whether they are governed by the
law of a Member State or by the law of a third country), excluding micro-
undertakings, must include in their annual financial reports a management report that
includes sustainability information at individual level (sustainability statement) or -
for parent undertakings of large groups - at consolidated level (consolidated
sustainability statement) in compliance with the same requirements specified under
paragraph 1.1 above, points (i) to (v). The publication rules are those established for
the annual financial report under Article 4 of the Transparency Directive50.
Issuers of transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market that
are large undertakings or SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) or parent
undertakings of large groups as defined in the Accounting Directive, will also have to
publish the management report in compliance with the requirements set out in the
Accounting Directive and specified under paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 above. Exemption
rules under Articles 19a(8) and 19a(9) of the Accounting Directive also apply.
46 Article 29a(7) Accounting Directive.
47 These conditions are set out in Article 29(8) Accounting Directive. See also FAQ 19.
48 Article 29a(9) Accounting Directive.
49 As defined in Article 2 points (a) and (d) of the Transparency Directive.
50 The sustainability reporting requirements set out in the Transparency Directive as amended by the CSRD do
not modify the pre-existing publication deadline for the annual financial report (which includes the management
report) specified in Article 4(1) Transparency Directive, i.e. at the latest 4 months after the balance sheet date.
9
These requirements must be complied with based on the following phased approach51:
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024 (i.e. with publication in
2025): issuers that are large undertakings exceeding on their balance sheet dates
an average number of 500 employees during the financial year, as well as issuers
that are parent undertakings of a large group exceeding on its balance sheet dates,
on a consolidated basis, an average number of 500 employees during the financial
year;
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025 (i.e. with publication in
2026): other issuers that are large undertakings, as well as to other issuers that are
parent undertakings of a large group;
− for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2026 (i.e. with publication in
2027):
• issuers that are SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings);
• issuers defined as small and non-complex institutions provided they are
large undertakings or SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with
transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market; and
• issuers defined as captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance
undertakings provided that they are either large undertakings or SMEs
(excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to
trading on an EU regulated market.
2. Preparation, assurance, and publication of the sustainability information to be
reported under Article 40a Accounting Directive (sustainability report for
certain third-country undertakings)
Based on Article 40a of the Accounting Directive, where a third-country undertaking
that generates a net turnover of more than EUR 150 million in the Union (for each of
the last two consecutive financial years) has a subsidiary in the Union that is subject
to Articles 19a/29a Accounting Directive, or, in the absence of such subsidiary, a
branch in the Union that generated a net turnover of more than EUR 40 million (in the
preceding financial year), the subsidiary or the branch will have to publish and make
accessible sustainability information at the group level of the third-country parent
undertaking.
This sustainability report to be provided under Article 40a of the Accounting
Directive has a limited content compared to the “sustainability statement” to be
provided under Articles 19a/29a of the Accounting Directive. Certain information that
is required in the sustainability statement is not required in the sustainability report, in
particular information on resilience, opportunities, and risks, since the intention above
all is to focus the sustainability report on sustainability impacts52.
The sustainability report must comply with the following requirements:
− it must be prepared in accordance with the ESRS for certain third-country
undertakings adopted by way of Commission delegated acts53;
51 Article 5(2) third subparagraph Accounting Directive.
52 Article 40a(1) Accounting Directive: “[…] sustainability report covering the information specified in points
(a)(iii) to (a)(v), points (b) to (f) and, where appropriate, point (h) of Article 29a(2)”.
53 Articles 40a(2) first subparagraph and 40b Accounting Directive. The time limit for the Commission to adopt
the ESRS for certain third-country undertaking was postponed to 30 June 2026 by Directive (EU) 2024/1306 of
10
− it must be subject to assurance54;
− it must be published by the relevant subsidiaries or branches established or
located in the Union together with the assurance opinion on the sustainability
report55.
If the third-country parent undertaking prepares the sustainability report in
compliance with the ESRS (instead of with the ESRS for certain third-country
undertakings), the subsidiary or branch does not need to prepare the sustainability
report in accordance with the ESRS for certain third-country undertakings. In this
case, the exemptions under Article 19a(9) and Article 29a(8) would apply.
These requirements must be complied with for each financial year beginning on or
after 1 January 202856.

REQUIREMENTS FOR STATUTORY AUDITORS AND INDEPENDENT
ASSURANCE SERVICES PROVIDERS (IASPS)
1. Assurance of the sustainability information to be reported under Articles 19a and
29a Accounting Directive (sustainability statement)
Under Article 34(1) second subparagraph, point (aa) of the Accounting Directive, any
undertaking subject to sustainability reporting under Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive must obtain an assurance opinion on the sustainability statement
included in their management report57.
From the first year of application of sustainability reporting requirements, this assurance
opinion must be based on a limited assurance engagement as regards the compliance of
the sustainability statement with the following requirements58:
− the sustainability reporting requirements provided for in the Accounting Directive
(including the compliance of the sustainability reporting with the ESRS adopted
pursuant to Articles 29b/29c of the Accounting Directive, the process carried out
by the undertaking to identify the information reported pursuant to those ESRS,
and the compliance with the requirement to mark-up sustainability reporting in
accordance with Article 29d of the Accounting Directive); and
− the reporting requirements provided for in Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.
Based on Article 26a of the Audit Directive, the Commission is empowered to adopt
sustainability assurance standards for limited assurance by 1 October 202659.
The Commission is empowered to adopt sustainability assurance standards for
reasonable assurance by 1 October 2028, following an assessment to determine if
reasonable assurance is feasible for auditors and for undertakings60.
57 Article 34(1) second subparagraph, point (aa) Accounting Directive: “The statutory auditor(s) or audit firm(s)
shall also: […] (aa) where applicable, express an opinion based on a limited assurance engagement as regards
the compliance of the sustainability reporting with the requirements of this Directive […]”.
58 Article 34(1) second subparagraph, point (aa) Accounting Directive: “The statutory auditor(s) or audit firm(s)
shall also: […] (aa) where applicable, express an opinion based on a limited assurance engagement as regards
the compliance of the sustainability reporting with the requirements of this Directive, including the compliance
of the sustainability reporting with the sustainability reporting standards adopted pursuant to Article 29b or
Article 29c, the process carried out by the undertaking to identify the information reported pursuant to those
sustainability reporting standards, and the compliance with the requirement to mark up sustainability reporting
in accordance with Article 29d, and as regards the compliance with the reporting requirements provided for in
Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; […]”
59 Article 26a(1) and (3) first subparagraph Audit Directive: “Member States shall require statutory auditors and
audit firms to carry out the assurance of sustainability reporting in compliance with the assurance standards
adopted by the Commission […]. The Commission shall, no later than 1 October 2026, adopt delegated acts
[…] in order to provide for limited assurance standards setting out the procedures that the auditor(s) and the
audit firm(s) shall perform in order to draw his, her or its conclusions on the assurance of sustainability
reporting, including engagement planning, risk consideration and response to risks and type of conclusions to
be included in the assurance report on sustainability reporting, or, where relevant, in the audit report […]”.
60 Article 26a(3) second subparagraph Audit Directive: “The Commission shall, no later than 1 October 2028,
adopt delegated acts […] in order to provide for reasonable assurance standards, following an assessment to
determine if reasonable assurance is feasible for auditors and for undertakings. Taking into account the results
of that assessment and if therefore appropriate, those delegated acts shall specify the date from which the
opinion referred to in point (aa) of the second subparagraph of Article 34(1) is to be based on a reasonable
assurance engagement that is based on those reasonable assurance standards.”.
14
Pending the adoption by the Commission of assurance standards on this subject matter,
Member States may apply national assurance standards, procedures or requirements
covering that subject matter61.
Based on Article 34 of the Accounting Directive, the opinion on the sustainability
reporting may be expressed by the following categories of assurance providers:
− the statutory auditor auditing the financial statements of the relevant undertaking62;
− a statutory auditor other than the one auditing the financial statements (where
allowed by a Member State)63;
− an Independent Assurance Services Provider “IASP” (where allowed by a Member
State)64.
If a Member State decides to allow an IASP to express the assurance opinion on the
sustainability reporting, it shall also allow a statutory auditor other than the one(s)
carrying out the statutory audit of financial statements to do so65.
2. Assurance of the sustainability information to be reported under Article 40a of the
Accounting Directive (sustainability report for certain third-country undertakings)
Under Article 40a(3) first subparagraph of the Accounting Directive, the subsidiaries or
branches subject to sustainability reporting under Article 40a of the Accounting
Directive must obtain an assurance opinion on the sustainability report66. The third-
country parent undertaking is responsible for providing the assurance opinion on the
sustainability report to the relevant subsidiary or branch67.
This assurance opinion must concern the compliance of this sustainability report with the
relevant requirements set out in the Accounting Directive, including the compliance of
the sustainability report with the ESRS adopted pursuant to Article 40b of the
Accounting Directive.
61 Article 26a(2) first subparagraph Audit Directive: “Member States may apply national assurance standards,
procedures or requirements as long as the Commission has not adopted an assurance standard covering the
same subject matter.”.
62 Article 34(1) first subparagraph Accounting Directive: “Member States shall ensure that the financial
statements of public-interest entities, medium-sized and large undertakings are audited by one or more statutory
auditors or audit firms approved by Member States to carry out statutory audits on the basis of Directive
2006/43/EC.”
63 Article 34(3) Accounting Directive: “Member States may allow a statutory auditor or an audit firm other
than the one(s) carrying out the statutory audit of financial statements to express the opinion referred to in point
(aa) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.”
64 Article 34(4) first subparagraph Accounting Directive: “ […] Member States may allow an independent
assurance services provider established in their territory to express the opinion referred to in point (aa) of the
second subparagraph of paragraph 1 […].”
65 Article 34(4) sixth subparagraph Accounting Directive: “If a Member State, pursuant to the first
subparagraph, decides to allow an independent assurance services provider to express the opinion referred to
in point (aa) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, it shall also allow a statutory auditor other than the
one(s) carrying out the statutory audit of financial statements to do so, as provided for in paragraph 3.”
66 Article 40a(3) first subparagraph Accounting Directive: “Member States shall require that the sustainability
report referred to in paragraph 1 is published accompanied by an assurance opinion […]”.
67 Article 40a(3) second subparagraph Accounting Directive: “In the event that the third-country undertaking
does not provide the assurance opinion in accordance with the first subparagraph, the subsidiary undertaking
or branch shall issue a statement indicating that the third-country undertaking did not make the necessary
assurance opinion available.”
15
This assurance opinion must be expressed by one or more person(s) or firm(s) authorised
to give an opinion on the assurance of sustainability reporting under the national law of
the third-country undertaking or of a Member State68.
3. Assurance providers: conditions to provide sustainability assurance
Where a statutory auditor or audit firm approved to carry out the audit of financial
statements within a Member State wishes to be approved to provide assurance on
sustainability reporting, it will have to comply with the national measures transposing the
relevant requirements set out in the Audit Directive as regards the assurance of
sustainability reporting.
These requirements cover in particular educational qualifications, examinations of
professional competence, tests of theoretical knowledge, practical training and
continuing education. Compliance with these requirements is not mandatory where the
statutory auditor or audit firm does not provide assurance on sustainability reporting.
Statutory auditors approved before 1 January 2026 – that were either approved before 1
January 2024 or that on 1 January 2024 were undergoing the approval process – that also
want to carry out sustainability assurance, do not have to comply with these
requirements, but still need to acquire the necessary knowledge through continuing
education69.
Independent Assurance Services Providers (IASPs) may provide assurance of
sustainability reporting where allowed by a Member State70 and under the following
conditions:
− The IASP is accredited for the assurance of sustainability reporting in accordance
with Regulation (EC) No 765/20087172; and
− the IASP complies with requirements equivalent to those set out in the Audit
Directive for statutory auditors in the Union to carry out the assurance of
sustainability reporting73. These requirements concern in particular: (a) training and
68 Article 40a(3) first subparagraph Accounting Directive: “Member States shall require that the sustainability
report referred to in paragraph 1 is published accompanied by an assurance opinion expressed by one or more
person(s) or firm(s) authorised to give an opinion on the assurance of sustainability reporting under the
national law of the third-country undertaking or of a Member State.”.

72 Article 2 point (20) Accounting Directive: “‘independent assurance services provider’ means a conformity
assessment body accredited in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and
of the Council for the specific conformity assessment activity referred to in point (aa) of the second
subparagraph of Article 34(1) of this Directive.”
73 Article 34(4) first subparagraph Accounting Directive: “Member States may allow an independent assurance
services provider established in their territory to express the opinion referred to in point (aa) of the second
subparagraph of paragraph 1, provided that such independent assurance services provider is subject to
requirements that are equivalent to those set out in Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council as regards the assurance of sustainability reporting as defined in point 22 of Article 2 of that
Directive, in particular the requirements on: (a) training and examination, ensuring that independent assurance
services providers acquire the necessary expertise concerning sustainability reporting and the assurance of
sustainability reporting; (b) continuing education; (c) quality assurance systems; (d) professional ethics,
independence, objectivity, confidentiality and professional secrecy; (e) appointment and dismissal; (f)
investigations and sanctions; (g) the organisation of the work of the independent assurance services provider, in
16
examination; (b) continuing education; (c) quality assurance systems; (d)
professional ethics, independence, objectivity, confidentiality and professional
secrecy; (e) appointment and dismissal; (f) investigations and sanctions; (g) the
organisation of the work of the independent assurance services provider, in
particular in terms of sufficient resources and personnel and the maintenance of
client account records and files; and (h) reporting irregularities.
From 6 January 2027, a Member State that allows IASPs to carry out assurance services
on sustainability reporting in its territory shall allow IASPs established in other Member
States to carry out the assurance of sustainability reporting in its territory74.
Third-country auditors and audit entities that provide sustainability assurance for
undertakings established in a third country with transferable securities admitted to
trading on the EU regulated market of a Member State must be registered in that Member
State75.
Section III – FAQs on sustainability information to be reported under Articles 19a/29a
of the Accounting Directive (individual and consolidated sustainability statement)
SCOPE AND APPLICATION DATES
1) Which financial year determines when an undertaking falls into a certain size-
category of undertakings: the financial year of the reporting year or the financial
year prior to the reporting year?
The rules to determine the size of an undertaking for sustainability reporting purposes
rely on the existing rules for financial reporting purposes applying to the undertaking
on the basis of the Member State in which it has its registered office76. These rules are
set out in the national measures transposing the preexisting Accounting Directive.
2) If an undertaking evolves during the course of a given financial year such that it
meets the criteria for inclusion in a different category of undertaking, is it
required to start reporting sustainability information according to the rules that
apply to that new category for that same financial year or only after the criteria
have been met for two consecutive financial years?
The rules to determine the size category of an undertaking for sustainability reporting
purposes, when that undertaking is evolving during the course of a given financial year,
particular in terms of sufficient resources and personnel and the maintenance of client account records and
files; and (h) reporting irregularities.
74 Article 34(5) first subparagraph Accounting Directive: “From 6 January 2027, a Member State that has made
use of the option provided for in paragraph 4 (the ‘host Member State’) shall allow independent assurance
services provider established in a Member State other than the host Member State (the ‘home Member State’) to
carry out the assurance of sustainability reporting.”
75 Article 45 Audit Directive.
76 In the case of undertakings with securities admitted to trading, the applicable financial reporting rules are
those of the Home Member State as defined in Article 2(1) point (i) of the Transparency Directive (i.e. the
Member State in which the undertaking has its registered office or one of the Member States where the
undertaking has its securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market).
17
rely on the existing rules for financial reporting purposes (see also FAQ 1). These rules
are set out in the national measures transposing the preexisting Accounting Directive.
3) How is the average number of employees calculated for the purpose of the
undertaking’s categorisation under the Accounting Directive?
Union legislation does not regulate the calculation of the average number of employees
for the purpose of the undertaking’s categorisation under the Accounting Directive.
However, Member States may have adopted national rules or provided guidance on this
matter. In the absence of national rules or guidance, undertakings may use Article 5 of
Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises77 as guidance regarding the measurement of staff
headcount, as a proxy of an average number of employees: “[…]The headcount
corresponds to the number of annual work units (AWU), i.e. the number of persons who
worked full-time within the enterprise in question or on its behalf during the entire
reference year under consideration. The work of persons who have not worked the full
year, the work of those who have worked part-time, regardless of duration, and the
work of seasonal workers are counted as fractions of AWU. The staff consists of: (a)
employees; (b) persons working for the enterprise being subordinated to it and deemed
to be employees under national law; (c) owner-managers; (d) partners engaging in a
regular activity in the enterprise and benefiting from financial advantages from the
enterprise. Apprentices or students engaged in vocational training with an
apprenticeship or vocational training contract are not included as staff. The duration
of maternity or parental leaves is not counted.”
4) Are SMEs without transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated
market required to report sustainability information under Articles 19a/29a of the
Accounting Directive?
SMEs without transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market are
not required to report sustainability information at individual level under Article 19a of
the Accounting Directive (individual sustainability statement). They are however
required to report sustainability information at consolidated level under Article 29a of
the Accounting Directive (consolidated sustainability statement) if they are parent
undertakings of a large group78. Article 29a of the Accounting Directive applies
regardless of the size of the parent undertaking.
5) Are credit institutions and insurance undertakings required to report
sustainability information under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive
regardless of their legal form?
Yes. Pursuant to Article 1(3) of the Accounting Directive, credit institutions79 and
insurance undertakings80, including cooperatives and mutual undertakings, are included
in the scope of Article 19a of the Accounting Directive (individual sustainability
77 Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36).
78 As defined in Article 3(7) Accounting Directive.
79 As defined in Article 4(1), point (1), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the
Council.

18
statement) regardless of their legal form if they are large undertakings or SMEs
(excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading on an
EU regulated market. They are also included in the scope of Article 29a of the
Accounting Directive (consolidated sustainability statement) regardless of their legal
form where they are the parent undertaking of a large group.
Pursuant to Article 1(3) point (b) second sentence of the Accounting Directive, Member
States may choose not to apply, wholly or in part, the sustainability reporting
requirements to specific credit institutions81.
6) Are financial institutions – other than insurance undertakings and credit
institutions – required to report sustainability information under Articles 19a/29a
of the Accounting Directive?
Yes. Financial institutions – other than insurance undertakings and credit institutions –
are included in the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive where
they meet both of the following requirements:
− They are undertakings incorporated as a type of undertaking listed in Annex I or II
of the Accounting Directive82;
− they are either large undertakings or SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with
transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market (Article 19a
of the Accounting Directive) and/or parent undertakings of a large group (Article
29a of the Accounting Directive).
7) If a Small and Non-Complex Institution (SNCI) is currently required to report
non-financial information under Directive 2014/95/EU (NFRD), does it have to
continue reporting non-financial information in accordance with the provisions of
NFRD until the CSRD regime starts applying to small and non-complex
institutions (i.e. from financial years starting on or after 1 January 2026)?
Yes. Based on Article 5(2) of the CSRD, a small and non-complex institution that is a
large undertaking or an SME (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market will be required to report
sustainability information in accordance with ESRS (or, alternatively, with LSME
ESRS) starting from financial year 2026. Therefore, a small and non-complex
institution that is currently required to report non-financial information under Article
19a of the Accounting Directive as introduced by Directive 2014/95/EU (NFRD)83 (i.e.
because, besides being a credit institution, it is also a large undertaking exceeding on its
balance sheet dates the criterion of an average number of 500 employees during the
financial year) would have to continue reporting under the NFRD regime until the
81 Article 1(3) point (b) second sentence Accounting Directive: “Member States may choose not to apply the
coordination measures referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph to the undertakings listed in
points (2) to (23) of Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council.”
82 Article 1(1) Accounting Directive: “1. The coordination measures prescribed by this Directive shall apply to
the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the types of undertakings
listed: (a) in Annex I; (b) in Annex II, where all of the direct or indirect members of the undertaking having
otherwise unlimited liability in fact have limited liability by reason of those members being undertakings which
are:(i) of the types listed in Annex I; or (ii) not governed by the law of a Member State but which have a legal
form comparable to those listed in Annex I. […]”.
83 Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 amending Directive
2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and
groups (OJ L 330, 15.11.2014, p. 1).
19
CSRD regime becomes applicable to small and non-complex institutions (i.e. from
financial year 2026).
8) If a Small and Non-Complex Institution (SNCI) is a parent company of a large
group, can that SNCI benefit from the derogation under Article 19a(6) of the
Accounting Directive and prepare sustainability reporting in accordance with
LSME ESRS?
If an undertaking (regardless of the size or the specific type, e.g. including SNCIs) is a
parent undertaking of a large group, it must publish a consolidated sustainability
statement under Article 29a of the Accounting Directive prepared in accordance with
ESRS. The possibility to use LSME ESRS in accordance with Article 19a(6) of the
Accounting Directive only applies to SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with
securities listed on an EU regulated market and to small and non-complex institutions,
captive insurance undertakings or captive reinsurance undertakings (provided they are
either large undertakings or SMEs - excluding micro-undertakings - with securities
listed on an EU regulated market for the preparation of their individual sustainability
statement. See also FAQ 10).
9) If a Small and Non-Complex Institution (SNCI) is a parent company of a large
group, when does it have to start reporting sustainability information?
If an SNCI is a parent undertaking of a large group, it must publish a consolidated
sustainability reporting using ESRS either from financial year 2024 (if the SNCI is a
Public Interest Entity exceeding on its balance sheet date, on a consolidated basis, an
average number of 500 employees during the financial year) or from financial year
2025 (in all other cases).
10) If an SNCI is a parent undertaking of a large group but is not required to issue
consolidated financial statements due to all its subsidiaries being immaterial, is
this SNCI still required to prepare and publish a consolidated sustainability
statement?
No. Article 29a of the Accounting Directive applies to parent undertakings of large
groups. However, if a parent undertaking of a large group is exempted from preparing
and publishing consolidated financial statements based on Article 23(10) of the
Accounting Directive (i.e. because it only has subsidiary undertakings which are
immaterial, both individually and collectively, or because all its subsidiary
undertakings can be excluded from consolidation by virtue of Article 23(9) of the
Accounting Directive), that parent undertaking is not required to prepare and publish a
consolidated sustainability statement. However, to the extent that such parent
undertaking is itself a large undertaking as defined in Article 3(4) of the Accounting
Directive and would therefore fall within the scope of Article 19a of the Accounting
Directive, that undertaking must prepare and publish an individual sustainability
statement in accordance with Article 19a of the Accounting Directive. This individual
sustainability statement must consider its subsidiaries when reporting about its value
chain in accordance with ESRS.
20
11) Are Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS)
and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) required to report sustainability
information under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive?
No. Based on Article 1(4) of the Accounting Directive, UCITS and AIFs are exempted
from reporting sustainability information under the Accounting Directive even if these
financial products are in the scope of the Accounting Directive84.
12) Are undertakings that manage Collective Investments in Transferable Securities
(UCITS) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) required to report
sustainability information under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting
Directive?
Article 1(4) of the Accounting Directive aims to exclude UCITS and AIFs from the
sustainability reporting requirements under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting
Directive.
However, undertakings that manage UCITS and AIFs would fall under the scope of the
sustainability reporting obligations under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting
Directive if they fulfil the legal form conditions under Article 1(1) of the Accounting
Directive, and if they meet the company size criteria under Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive.
13) Are Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
required to report sustainability information under Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive?
As regards ETFs, since these financial products are established as Collective
Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) or Alternative Investment Funds
(AIFs), the same exemption applicable to UCITS and AIFs applies (see FAQ 11). As
regards listed REITs, to the extent that they meet the conditions of Article 4(1)(a) of
Directive 2011/61/EU85 to qualify as AIFs, the same exemption applicable to AIFs
applies (see FAQ 11).
14) Are pension funds required to report sustainability information under Articles
19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive?
If a pension fund is incorporated as a type of undertaking listed in Annex I or II of the
Accounting Directive86 and falls under the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive, it will have to include in its management report a sustainability
statement. Unlike Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) or
Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), pension funds are not covered by the exclusion
from the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Article 1(4) of the Accounting
Directive.
84 Article 1(4) Accounting Directive: “The coordination measures prescribed by Articles 19a, 29a and 29d shall
not apply to financial products listed in points (b) [i.e. UICTS] and (f) [i.e. AIFs] of point (12) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council [i.e. SFDR] “.
85 Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative
Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No
1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010 (OJ L 174, 1.7.2011, p. 1).
86 Article 1(1) of the Accounting Directive.
21
15) Is the sustainability statement published within the management report by an
issuer of transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market to
be considered as “regulated information” as per Article 2(1) point (k) of the
Transparency Directive?
Yes. Article 2(1) point (k) of the Transparency Directive defines regulated information
as, inter alia, “all information which the issuer, or any other person who has applied for
the admission of securities to trading on a regulated market without the issuer's
consent, is required to disclose under this Directive [i.e. the Transparency Directive]
[…]”. Article 4(5) of the Transparency Directive requires issuers to disclose a
sustainability statement, which is therefore to be considered as “regulated information”.
16) Which companies may opt out of the obligation to report sustainability
information for financial years starting before 1 January 2028 pursuant to Article
19a(7) of the Accounting Directive?
Based on Article 19a(7) of the Accounting Directive, SMEs (excluding micro-
undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated
market may decide not to report sustainability information under Article 19a of the
Accounting Directive for financial years starting before 1 January 2028 (e.g. for
financial years 2026 and 2027). In such cases, the SME shall, nevertheless, briefly state
in its management report why the sustainability reporting was not provided.
This opt-out also applies to small and non-complex institutions, as well as to captive
insurance and reinsurance undertakings, provided they are SMEs (excluding micro-
undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated
market.
EXEMPTION RULES
17) If a parent undertaking reports sustainability information at consolidated level
under Article 29a of the Accounting Directive (consolidated sustainability
statement), does it have to report information on key performance indicators in
accordance with Article 19(1) third subparagraph of the Accounting Directive in
its consolidated management report?
No. Article 19(1) third subparagraph of the Accounting Directive87, which regulates the
individual management report, requires the disclosure of information on key
performance indicators within the individual management report. Article 29(1) of the
Accounting Directive88, which regulates the consolidated management report, requires
87 Article 19(1) third subparagraph Accounting Directive: “To the extent necessary for an understanding of the
undertaking's development, performance or position, the analysis shall include both financial and, where
appropriate, non-financial key performance indicators relevant to the particular business, including
information relating to environmental and employee matters. In providing the analysis, the management report
shall, where appropriate, include references to, and additional explanations of, amounts reported in the annual
financial statements.”
88 Article 29(1) Accounting Directive: “The consolidated management report shall, as a minimum, in addition to
any other information required under other provisions of this Directive, set out the information required by
Articles 19 and 20, taking account of the essential adjustments resulting from the particular characteristics of a
22
that the consolidated management report sets out, as a minimum, the information
required by Articles 19 and 20 of the Accounting Directive. Since Article 29a(7) of the
Accounting Directive89 exempts undertakings from disclosing information on key
performance indicators in the context of their individual management report (as
required by Article 19(1) third subparagraph Accounting Directive) where they have
complied with Article 29a(1) to (5), and since the contents of the consolidated
management report according to Article 29(1) shall also include the information
required under Article 19(1), the exemption would also apply to the undertaking’s
consolidated management report under Article 29a.
18) If an SME with securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market chooses
to voluntarily prepare and publish a consolidated sustainability statement under
Article 29a Accounting Directive, shall it be exempted from preparing and
publishing its individual sustainability statement under Article 19a Accounting
Directive?
Yes. An SME with securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market that
voluntarily publishes the consolidated sustainability statement referred to in Article 29a
of the Accounting Directive shall be exempted from preparing and publishing the
individual sustainability statement referred to in Article 19a of the Accounting
Directive, provided that the consolidated sustainability statement is prepared in
compliance with ESRS.
19) What are the conditions for a subsidiary undertaking in the scope of Articles
19a/29a of the Accounting Directive to be exempted from reporting sustainability
information under Articles 19a/29a of the Accounting Directive (sustainability
statement)?
According to Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8) of the Accounting Directive, an undertaking
which is a subsidiary undertaking shall be exempted from the obligations set out in
Article 19a(1) to (4) of the Accounting Directive (or Article 29a(1) to (5) of the
Accounting Directive if the subsidiary is itself an intermediate parent undertaking of a
large group) if such undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings are included in the
consolidated management report of a parent undertaking drawn up in accordance with
Articles 29 and 29a of the Accounting Directive (or in the consolidated sustainability
reporting of a third-country parent undertaking carried out in accordance with ESRS or
in a manner equivalent to those ESRS).
This exemption is subject to all the conditions listed in Article 19a(9) second
subparagraph of the Accounting Directive (or Article 29a(8) second subparagraph of
the Accounting Directive if the subsidiary is itself an intermediate parent undertaking
of a large group). In particular, the management report of the exempted undertaking
must contain: the name and registered office of the parent undertaking that reports the
information at group level; weblink(s) to the consolidated management report or
consolidated sustainability reporting of the parent undertaking; and the information that
the undertaking is exempted from the obligation to publish the individual sustainability
consolidated management report as compared to a management report in a way which facilitates the
assessment of the position of the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.”
89 Article 29a(7) Accounting Directive: “A parent undertaking that complies with the requirements set out in
paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements set out in the third
subparagraph of Article 19(1) and Article 19a”.
23
statement (or the consolidated sustainability statement, if the subsidiary is itself an
intermediate parent undertaking of a large group). If the parent undertaking is
established in a third country, its consolidated sustainability reporting and the assurance
opinion must be published in accordance with the law of the Member State by which
the subsidiary undertaking is governed, and the disclosures laid down in Article 8 of the
Taxonomy Regulation (covering the activities carried out by the subsidiary
undertaking) must be included either in the management report of the subsidiary
undertaking or in the consolidated sustainability reporting carried out by the third-
country parent undertaking.
If a Member State requires that a translation of the consolidated management report or
the consolidated sustainability reporting of the parent undertaking is provided, such
translation should either be certified (e.g. by the translator or by the authority in charge
of certifying translations of the relevant Member State), or include a statement
specifying that it was not certified.
Under Articles 19a(10) and 29a(9) of the Accounting Directive, large undertakings with
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market – including where they are
small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive
reinsurance undertakings and including where they are third-country undertakings –
cannot avail of this exemption.
20) Does the consolidated management report/consolidated sustainability reporting of
the parent undertaking have to be already published when its subsidiary publishes
its own management report in order for the subsidiary to be exempted from
publishing its own sustainability statement?
No. For the subsidiary undertaking to be exempted from publishing its own
sustainability statement in accordance with Articles 19a(9) or 29a(8) of the Accounting
Directive, the management report that the subsidiary undertaking publishes must
contain a weblink to the consolidated management report or consolidated sustainability
reporting of the parent undertaking90. Where that consolidated management report or
consolidated sustainability reporting is not yet available at the time of publication of the
subsidiary undertaking’s management report, the subsidiary undertaking claiming the
exemption can make reference in its management report to a general weblink at which
the relevant documents will be available in the future. The Union subsidiary could
consider, for instance, obtaining from the parent undertaking a declaration that it
guarantees the commitments entered into by the subsidiary undertaking and publishing
that declaration together with its management report within the deadline set by its own
Member State.
90 Article 19a(9) second subparagraph, point (a), point (ii) and Article 29a(8) second subparagraph, point (a),
point (ii) Accounting Directive: “the weblinks to the consolidated management report of the parent undertaking
or, where applicable, to the consolidated sustainability reporting of the parent undertaking, as referred to in the
first subparagraph of this paragraph, and to the assurance opinion referred to in point (aa) of the second
subparagraph of Article 34(1) of this Directive or to the assurance opinion referred to in point (b) of this
subparagraph”.
24
21) Does the consolidated management report or the consolidated sustainability
reporting of the parent undertaking have to be available in a language accepted by
the Member State by whose national law the subsidiary undertaking is governed
in order for the subsidiary to be exempted from publishing its own sustainability
statement?
The Member State by whose national law the subsidiary undertaking is governed may
require that the consolidated management report (or, where applicable, the consolidated
sustainability reporting of the parent undertaking) is published in a language that such
Member State accepts, and that any necessary translation into such language is
provided. In this case, these requirements must be met in order for the subsidiary
undertaking to be exempted from publishing its own sustainability statement91.
22) How should the exempted subsidiary report the fact that it is exempted?
Based on Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8) of the Accounting Directive, the exempted
subsidiary must include in its management report the information that it is exempted
from the obligation to publish an individual sustainability statement (or a consolidated
sustainability statement, if the subsidiary is itself an intermediate parent undertaking of
a large group)92.
23) Should the management report of the exempted subsidiary be in a specific
publication format?
Where a subsidiary avails of the exemption in Article 19a(9) or 29a(8) of the
Accounting Directive, the general rules on the publication of the management report
apply, including the obligation to submit the management report to the national
Business Register pursuant to Article 30 of the Accounting Directive in conjunction
with the provisions in Chapter III of title I of the Company Law Directive. The digital
requirements for sustainability reporting set out in Article 29d of the Accounting
Directive do not apply. Where the subsidiary availing of the exemption in Article
19a(9) or 29a(8) of the Accounting Directive has transferable securities admitted to
trading on an EU regulated market, it will also have to comply with the general
requirements set out by Article 4 of the Transparency Directive for the publication of
the management report within the annual financial report (i.e. use of the European
Single Electronic Format (ESEF) established by the ESEF Delegated Regulation and
publication of the annual financial report within four months from the end of the
financial year).
24) Can large undertakings admitted to trading on an EU regulated market avail of
the exemptions under Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8) of the Accounting Directive?
No. Under Articles 19a(10) and 29a(9) of the Accounting Directive, large undertakings
with transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market – including
where they are small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and
captive reinsurance undertakings and including where they are third-country
91 Articles 19a(9) third subparagraph and 29a(8) third subparagraph Accounting Directive.
92 Article 19a(9) second subparagraph, point (a), point (iii) and Article 29a(8) second subparagraph, point (a),
point (iii) Accounting Directive: “the information that the undertaking is exempted from the obligations set out
in paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article”.
25
undertakings – cannot be exempted from reporting sustainability information. They will
therefore have to report sustainability information pursuant to Article 4(5) of the
Transparency Directive and to Articles 19a/29a of the Accounting Directive.
25) How can an undertaking comply with the obligation to prepare and publish an
individual or a consolidated sustainability statement when it is not required to
prepare and publish an individual or a consolidated management report?
An undertaking that must report sustainability information and that is not required to
prepare and publish an individual or a consolidated management report may publish the
individual or consolidated sustainability statement in a separate document. This
principle also applies to the consolidated sustainability reporting of a third-country
parent undertaking for its subsidiaries to be exempted under Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8)
of the Accounting Directive.
However, that separate document – which includes the individual or consolidated
sustainability statement – must comply with the format and the mark-up requirements
set out in Article 29d of the Accounting Directive93.
26) How can an undertaking comply with the obligation to prepare and publish a
consolidated sustainability statement when it is exempted from preparing
consolidated financial statements?
An undertaking that must prepare and publish a consolidated sustainability statement
without having to prepare and publish the corresponding consolidated financial
statements will need to include in the consolidated sustainability statement the financial
information necessary to understand the undertaking’s impacts on sustainability matters
and to understand how sustainability matters affect the undertaking’s development,
performance and position94.
ESRS
27) Which set of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) shall
undertakings use for the preparation of the sustainability information under
Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive?
93 Article 29d Accounting Directive: “1. Undertakings subject to the requirements of Article 19a of this
Directive shall prepare their management report in the electronic reporting format specified in Article 3 of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 ( 26 ) and shall mark up their sustainability reporting,
including the disclosures provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with the
electronic reporting format specified in that Delegated Regulation. 2. Parent undertakings subject to the
requirements of Article 29a shall prepare their consolidated management report in the electronic reporting
format specified in Article 3 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 and shall mark up their sustainability
reporting, including the disclosures provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with
the electronic reporting format specified in that Delegated Regulation.”
94 This reasoning is based on Article 19a(3) third subparagraph and Article 29a(3) third subparagraph
Accounting Directive: “Where applicable, the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also contain
references to, and additional explanations of, the other information included in the management report in
accordance with Article 19, and the amounts reported in the annual financial statements.”. “Where applicable”
is meant to refer to the situations where financial statements are not being prepared and published by the
undertaking.
26
All undertakings falling within the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting
Directive shall use, by default, the ESRS adopted under Article 29b of the Accounting
Directive (ESRS). The first set of ESRS was adopted by the European Commission via
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 2023.
For the preparation of the individual sustainability statement under Article 19a of the
Accounting Directive, SMEs (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market, as well as small and non-
complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance
undertakings, may alternatively use the proportionate ESRS that will be adopted
pursuant to Article 29c of the Accounting Directive (LSME ESRS). See also FAQ 28.
28) Which undertakings may use LSME ESRS to prepare their individual
sustainability statement as an alternative to the ESRS adopted under Article 29b
of the Accounting Directive?
The undertakings that may use LSME ESRS to prepare their individual sustainability
statement are:
− SMEs (excluding micro undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to
trading on an EU regulated market;
− small and non-complex institutions95, provided that they are either (i) large
undertakings; or (ii) SMEs (excluding micro undertakings) with transferable
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market;
− captive insurance undertakings96 provided they are either: (i) large undertakings; or
(ii) SMEs (excluding micro undertakings) with transferable securities admitted to
trading on an EU regulated market; and
− captive reinsurance undertakings97 provided they are either: (i) large undertakings;
or (ii) SMEs (excluding micro undertakings) with securities admitted to trading on
an EU regulated market.
VALUE CHAIN
95 Defined in point (145) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as “an institution that meets all the
following conditions: (a) it is not a large institution; (b) the total value of its assets on an individual basis or,
where applicable, on a consolidated basis in accordance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU is on
average equal to or less than the threshold of EUR 5 billion over the four-year period immediately preceding the
current annual reporting period; Member States may lower that threshold; (c) it is not subject to any obligations,
or is subject to simplified obligations, in relation to recovery and resolution planning in accordance with Article
4 of Directive 2014/59/EU; (d) its trading book business is classified as small within the meaning of Article
94(1); (e) the total value of its derivative positions held with trading intent does not exceed 2 % of its total on-
and off-balance-sheet assets and the total value of its overall derivative positions does not exceed 5 %, both
calculated in accordance with Article 273a(3); (f) more than 75 % of both the institution's consolidated total
assets and liabilities, excluding in both cases the intragroup exposures, relate to activities with counterparties
located in the European Economic Area; (g) the institution does not use internal models to meet the prudential
requirements in accordance with this Regulation except for subsidiaries using internal models developed at the
group level, provided that the group is subject to the disclosure requirements laid down in Article 433a or 433c
on a consolidated basis; (h) the institution has not communicated to the competent authority an objection to
being classified as a small and non-complex institution; (i) the competent authority has not decided that the
institution is not to be considered a small and non-complex institution on the basis of an analysis of its size,
interconnectedness, complexity or risk profile”. These institutions may fall within the definition of large
undertakings if they meet the thresholds under Article 3(7) of the Accounting Directive.

97 Defined in point (5) of Article 13 of Directive 2009/138/EC.
27
29) ESRS require undertakings to use estimates if they cannot obtain all necessary
value chain information after having made reasonable efforts to do so (ESRS 1,
General requirements, paragraph 69). What constitutes “reasonable effort”?
The concept of “reasonable effort” is used to determine when an undertaking shall
report an estimate of value chain information instead of reporting information collected
from actors in its value chain.
Paragraph 65 of ESRS 1 (General requirements) sets out the purpose of including value
chain information in the sustainability statement. It states that “the undertaking shall
include material value chain information when this is necessary to: (a) allow users of
sustainability statements to understand the undertaking’s material impacts, risks and
opportunities; and/or (b) produce a set of information that meets the qualitative
characteristics of information (see Appendix B of this Standard)”.
Paragraph 68 of ESRS 1 (General requirements) states: “The undertaking’s ability to
obtain the necessary upstream and downstream value chain information may vary
depending on various factors, such as the undertaking’s contractual arrangements, the
level of control that it exercises on the operations outside the consolidation scope and
its buying power. When the undertaking does not have the ability to control the
activities of its upstream and/or downstream value chain and its business relationships,
obtaining value chain information may be more challenging.”
Paragraph 69 of ESRS 1 (General requirements) states: “There are circumstances
where the undertaking cannot collect the information about its upstream and
downstream value chain as required by paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts
to do so. In these circumstances, the undertaking shall estimate the information to be
reported about its upstream and downstream value chain, by using all reasonable and
supportable information, such as sector-average data and other proxies.”
Paragraph 70 of ESRS 1 (General requirements) recognises that it may be challenging
to obtain value chain information when the relevant actor in the value chain is an SME
or another undertaking that is itself not subject to the reporting requirements of the
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.
Paragraph 71 of ESRS 1 (General requirements) makes a distinction between reporting
on policies, actions and targets, and reporting on metrics. With regard to policies,
actions and targets, it states that the undertaking shall report value chain information
“to the extent that those policies, actions and targets involve actors in the value chain”.
With reference to metrics, it states that “in many cases, in particular for environmental
matters for which proxies are available, the undertaking may be able to comply with
the reporting requirements without collecting data from the actors in its upstream and
downstream value chain, especially from SMEs, for example, when calculating the
undertaking’s GHG Scope 3 emissions”.
Paragraph 72 clarifies that: “The incorporation of estimates made using sector-average
data or other proxies shall not result in information that does not meet the qualitative
characteristics of information (see chapter 2 and section 7.2 Sources of estimation and
outcome uncertainty of this Standard).”
28
The undertaking should determine reasonable effort as referred to in paragraph 69 of
ESRS 1 (General requirements) taking into consideration its specific facts and
circumstances as well as the conditions of the external environment in which it
operates. What constitutes reasonable effort is therefore likely to vary from undertaking
to undertaking.
It is expected that undertakings will more frequently have recourse to the use of
estimates in the first years of application of the reporting requirements and that the use
of estimates will become less common as the ability of undertakings and the actors in
their value chains to share sustainability information improves over time.
In all cases the undertaking should consider whether the use of estimates is likely to
affect the quality of the reported information. The use of estimates could, in some
circumstances, enhance the quality of reported information, for example if it helps to
ensure that information about the impacts, risks and opportunities is neutral, or if the
collected information would not be of the appropriate reliability. In these circumstances
the use of estimates would contribute to a more faithful representation of the
phenomena that the information purports to represent and the reporting undertaking is
therefore more likely to use estimates. In other circumstances the use of estimates could
reduce the quality of the reported information, for example if it results in information
that is less accurate and/or less complete and therefore results in a less faithful
representation of the phenomena that it purports to represent.
When considering the specific facts and circumstances of the undertaking and the
conditions of the external environment in which it operates in order to determine
reasonable effort, the following criteria could offer useful guidance. Any one of these
criteria could on its own be sufficient to determine that reasonable effort has been
made, or the criteria could be applied in combination.
− The size and resources of the reporting undertaking in relation the scale and
complexity of its value chain. What constitutes reasonable effort for a larger,
well-resourced undertaking might not be considered reasonable for a smaller,
typically less well-resourced undertaking. The size and resources of the
undertaking should also be considered in relation to the scale and complexity of its
value chain. For example, what constitutes reasonable effort for a larger
undertaking with a large number of suppliers for multiple different products, and/or
with supply chains that comprise many tiers, might be considered unreasonable for
a smaller undertaking with a similarly complex value chain.
− The technical readiness of the reporting undertaking to collect value chain
information. For example, what constitutes reasonable effort for a very large
undertaking with substantial prior experience of collecting sustainability
information from actors in its value chain might not be considered reasonable in
the case of a smaller undertaking with no such prior experience. The technical
readiness of undertakings to collect value chain information is expected to improve
over time.
− The availability of tools to access and share value-chain information. What
constitutes reasonable effort may be influenced by the availability of efficient and
commonly used tools, including digital tools, to share value chain information
between undertakings. The availability of such tools is likely to be limited in the
first years of applying the ESRS but should improve over time, including as a
result of the voluntary SME sustainability reporting standards currently being
developed by EFRAG (VSME). This means that undertakings are more likely to
29
have recourse to the use of estimates in the first years of applying the ESRS than
they will do in later reporting cycles.
− The size and resources of the actor in the value chain. What constitutes
reasonable effort may be influenced by the size and resources of the actor in the
value chain from which information is expected. SMEs in particular may not have
the necessary resources to easily and quickly provide the information that may be
of interest to the reporting undertaking, which in turn makes it harder for the
reporting undertaking to gather the necessary value chain information from SMEs.
Where the value chain actor is an SME, the reporting undertaking is therefore more
likely to have recourse to the use of estimates. In general, the application of
reasonable effort by the reporting undertaking should not result in expectations on
the actor in the value chain to apply unreasonable effort.
− The technical readiness of the actor in the value chain. What constitutes
reasonable effort may be influenced by the technical readiness of the actor in the
value chain to provide sustainability information. The technical readiness of actors
in the value chain should improve over time, which implies that undertakings are
more likely to have recourse to the use of estimates in the first years of applying
the ESRS than they will do in later reporting cycles.
− Level of influence and buying power. What constitutes reasonable effort may be
influenced by the existing level of control of the reporting undertaking over the
actor in the value chain and by the relative buying power of the reporting
undertaking compared to other undertakings. For example, less effort may be
required to obtain information from an actor in the value chain that is partly owned
by the reporting undertaking or that generates a high proportion of its own turnover
through sales to the reporting undertaking. This means that undertakings are more
likely to have recourse to the use of estimates in the case of actors in the value
chain which they do not partly own or for which they only represent a small
proportion of turnover.
− Connected to the level of influence, the ‘proximity’ of the actor in the value
chain. The ‘proximity’ of the actor in the value chain to the reporting undertaking
may be a consideration in determining what constitutes reasonable effort, since less
effort is usually required to obtain information from a tier 1 supplier or a direct
customer than from other actors in the value chain. This means that undertakings
are more likely to have recourse to the use of estimates in the case of actors in the
value chain that are not tier 1 suppliers or direct customers.
30) What should an SME expect to receive in terms of requests for sustainability
information as a consequence of the CSRD and ESRS?
Paragraphs 132 and 133 of ESRS 1 (General requirements) set out transitional
provisions that limit the value chain information that undertakings within the scope of
the CSRD have to report and/or collect from actors in their value chain during the first
3 years.98 The extent to which SMEs are asked to provide sustainability information by
98 Paragraph 132: “For the first 3 years of the undertaking’s sustainability reporting under the ESRS, in the
event that not all the necessary information regarding its upstream and downstream value chain is available,
the undertaking shall explain the efforts made to obtain the necessary information about its upstream and
downstream value chain, the reasons why not all of the necessary information could be obtained, and its plans
to obtain the necessary information in the future.” Paragraph 133: “For the first 3 years of its sustainability
reporting under the ESRS, in order to take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in
gathering information from actors throughout their value chain and in order to limit the burden for SMEs in the
30
undertakings as a consequence of the CSRD and ESRS will, during the first 3 years of
implementation, be strongly influenced by whether undertakings that fall within the
scope of CSRD make use of these transitional provisions regarding value chain
reporting.
Notwithstanding the transitional provisions referred to above, SMEs should expect
undertakings that fall under the scope of CSRD to apply “reasonable effort” to collect
from actors in their value chains the information they need in order to comply with
ESRS. In accordance with the answer to the previous question, the size and resources,
the technical readiness and the proximity of the actor in the value chain are among the
criteria that can be used to establish what constitutes “reasonable effort”. Therefore,
smaller SMEs that have never voluntarily reported sustainability information, that are
not connected with severe negative impacts and are not 1st tier suppliers or customers of
undertakings that fall within the scope of the CSRD should, at least during the first
years of application of the reporting requirements, be less exposed to expectations to
have and share sustainability information. Larger SMEs that have previously reported
sustainability information (for example because they apply EMAS or other
environmental or sustainability certification or reporting schemes) and SMEs that are
1st tier suppliers or customers of undertakings that fall within the scope of the CSRD
may be exposed to higher expectations to have and share sustainability information.
EFRAG is currently developing two sustainability reporting standards for SMEs: a
mandatory one for listed SMEs (LSME ESRS) and a voluntary one for non-listed
SMEs (VSME). LSME ESRS will establish the maximum level of sustainability
information that ESRS can require an undertaking that falls within the scope of the
CSRD to obtain from SMEs in its value chain. VSME will be designed to become a
reference point for all actors in the market, to ensure that the reporting effort of CSRD
and non-CSRD undertakings is proportionate.
31) Until when does the transitional period for the disclosure of information in the
value chain apply? Should the commencement date for the three-year transitional
period be different for each type of undertaking?
Chapter 10.2 of ESRS 1 sets out transitional provisions related to chapter 5 on value
chains. The transitional period for the disclosure of information required from the value
chain applies for the first 3 financial years of application of the reporting requirements,
for each undertaking. For example, if an undertaking falls within the scope of Articles
19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive as of financial year 2024, then it may avail of
the transitional period for value chain reporting for financial years 2024, 2025 and
2026.
ARTICLE 8 TAXONOMY REGULATION DISCLOSURES
value chain: (a) when disclosing information on policies, actions and targets in accordance with ESRS2 and
other ESRS, the undertaking may limit upstream and downstream value chain information to information
available in-house, such as data already available to the undertaking and publicly available information; and
(b) when disclosing metrics, the undertaking is not required to include upstream and downstream value chain
information, except for datapoints derived from other EU legislation, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B.”
31
32) Do undertakings have to include Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation disclosures in
their sustainability statement?
Yes, undertakings in the scope of Articles 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive must
include Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation disclosures in their sustainability statements.
33) If an SME with transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated
market avails of the 2-year opt-out from sustainability reporting until 2028, does it
have to still include Article 8 Taxonomy disclosures in its management report?
No. Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation applies to all undertakings required to prepare and
publish a sustainability statement under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting
Directive. However, if an SME (excluding micro-undertakings) with transferable
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market decides not to include in its
management report the sustainability statement under Article 19a(7) of the Accounting
Directive – where Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation disclosures would need to be
included – it is not required to disclose Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation disclosures.
34) Are undertakings required to include in their management report the information
to be disclosed under Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation even if they are exempted
from preparing and publishing their sustainability statement under Article 19a(9)
and 29a(8) of the Accounting Directive?
Yes, but only if the parent undertaking is established in a third country and Article 8
Taxonomy Regulation disclosures are not included in the parent’s consolidated
sustainability reporting. Where the undertaking avails of the exemption from the
obligation to disclose a sustainability statement under Articles 19a(9) or 29a(8) of the
Accounting Directive, if the parent undertaking is established in a third country, Article
8 Taxonomy Regulation disclosures, covering the activities carried out by the exempted
subsidiary undertaking established in the Union and its subsidiary undertakings, must
be included in the management report of the exempted subsidiary undertaking, or in the
consolidated sustainability reporting carried out by the parent undertaking established
in a third country99.
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS
35) In which language should the sustainability statement be drafted and published?
Undertakings subject to Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive should
publish the management report (including the sustainability statement), together with
the opinion and statement submitted by the statutory auditor or audit firm referred to in
Article 34 Accounting Directive, in accordance with Article 30(1) of the Accounting
Directive, which refers to the laws laid down by each Member State in accordance with
Chapter III of Title 1 of the Company Law Directive. In particular, Article 21 of the
Company Law Directive clarifies that “1. Documents and particulars to be disclosed
pursuant to Article 14 shall be drawn up and filed in one of the languages permitted by
the language rules applicable in the Member State in which the file referred to in
99 Articles 19a(9) second subparagraph, point (c) Accounting Directive.
32
Article 16(1) is opened”. Therefore, the language that undertakings shall use to publish
the sustainability statement included in the management report must be a language
specified by the laws of the relevant Member State adopted in accordance with Article
21 of the Company Law Directive.
If an undertaking subject to Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive has
securities listed on an EU regulated market, it will also have to comply with the
disclosure obligations set out in the Transparency Directive concerning the
management report. The linguistic regime for “regulated information”, which includes
the management report as part of the annual financial report, is laid down by each
Member State in accordance with Article 20 of the Transparency Directive.
DIGITALISATION (FORMAT AND DIGITAL TAGGING)
36) What are the digital format requirements for the management report that
includes a sustainability statement?
Article 29d of the Accounting Directive requires undertakings that have to carry out
sustainability reporting to prepare their management report (at consolidated level,
where applicable) in the electronic reporting format specified in Article 3 of the ESEF
Delegated Regulation (i.e. XHTML) and to mark-up their sustainability statement
within the management report in accordance with the digital taxonomy to be specified
by way of an amendment to the ESEF Delegated Regulation.
37) Do undertakings also have to mark-up Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation
disclosures?
Yes. Article 29d of the Accounting Directive requires undertakings that have to publish
a sustainability statement in their management report to mark-up their sustainability
statement, including the disclosures provided for in Article 8 of the Taxonomy
Regulation, in accordance with the digital taxonomy to be specified by way of an
amendment to the ESEF Delegated Regulation.
38) What are the format requirements that undertakings need to comply with pending
the adoption by the European Commission of a digital taxonomy for the mark-up
of the sustainability statement?
Article 29d of the Accounting Directive requires undertakings that have to publish a
sustainability statement in their management report to prepare their management report
in the electronic reporting format specified in Article 3 of the ESEF Delegated
Regulation (i.e. in XHTML) and to mark-up the sustainability statement within the
management report in accordance with the specific digital taxonomy that will be
adopted by way of an amendment to the ESEF Delegated Regulation. Until the
adoption of this digital taxonomy, undertakings are not required to mark-up their
sustainability statements. Considering that the sustainability statement will become
machine-readable only once it is both included in an XHTML document and marked-up
with a digital taxonomy, pending the adoption of the digital taxonomy undertakings are
also not required to prepare the management report in XHTML.
PUBLICATION
33
39) What is the deadline for the publication of the management report that includes
the sustainability statement?
Article 30 of the Accounting Directive sets out the rules for the publication of the
management report (which includes the sustainability statement prepared under Articles
19a/29a of the Accounting Directive, where relevant), which must be published
together with the assurance opinion/report and within at the latest 12 months of the
balance sheet date of the financial year for which the report is drawn up, as provided for
by each Member State.
Undertakings that are issuers of securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated
market are also required to publish their annual financial report (which includes the
management report, therefore the sustainability statement) at the latest four months
after the end of each financial year, based on Article 4(5) of the Transparency
Directive, which cross-refers to Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive.
SUPERVISION
40) Which authorities are in charge of supervising compliance with the requirements
for the sustainability statement prepared in accordance with Articles 19a and 29a
of the Accounting Directive?
The CSRD does not introduce any changes to the pre-existing EU supervisory regime,
which requires Member States to have in place penalties that are effective,
proportionate and dissuasive for the cases of non-compliance by limited liability
undertakings (Article 51 of the Accounting Directive), and to establish a national
supervisory authority with powers to supervise compliance by issuers of transferable
securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market (Articles 28 and subsequent of
the Transparency Directive). This means that undertakings’ compliance with
sustainability reporting requirements will be subject to the national sanctioning regime
in place for the management report of limited liability undertakings (subject to the
Accounting Directive) and of issuers of transferable securities admitted to trading on an
EU regulated market (subject to the Transparency Directive). As regards issuers of
transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market, ESMA is also
required to issue guidelines on the supervision of sustainability reporting by national
competent authorities pursuant to Article 28d Transparency Directive.
In any case, the sustainability statement to be included in the management report must
always be subject to assurance by a statutory auditor, or by an Independent Assurance
Services Provider (IASP) where allowed by a Member State, under Article 34 of the
Accounting Directive.
Section IV – FAQs on sustainability information reported under Article 40a of the
Accounting Directive
SCOPE AND APPLICATION DATE
34
41) Does the ultimate third-country parent undertaking have to have a certain legal
form in order to fall under the scope of Article 40a of the Accounting Directive?
No. The legal form of the ultimate third-country parent undertaking is irrelevant for the
purposes of Article 40a of the Accounting Directive.
42) What are the obligations for the EU subsidiary or the EU branch under Article
40a of the Accounting Directive? Is the EU subsidiary/branch required to prepare
the sustainability report or just to publish and make accessible the sustainability
report prepared by its parent undertaking?
If a third-country undertaking falls within the scope of Article 40a of the Accounting
Directive, then either its EU subsidiary or EU branch will have to publish and make
accessible a sustainability report on behalf of its third-country parent undertaking. The
obligation to prepare the sustainability report does not explicitly fall on the EU
subsidiary or branch. This means that the third-country parent may prepare the report,
which will then be published and made accessible by the EU subsidiary or branch,
either by filing it in an EU business register or by publishing it on its website.
Alternatively, the EU subsidiary or branch may prepare, publish and make accessible
the report on behalf of its third-country parent undertaking.
43) Does each EU subsidiary or EU branch have to publish a sustainability report
under Article 40a of the Accounting Directive? Or is it sufficient that only one of
the EU subsidiaries or branches publishes the report and the other ones simply
provide a link to that sustainability report?
Article 40a of the Accounting Directive requires that at least one sustainability report
be disclosed by one subsidiary or branch in each Member State (“A Member State shall
require that a subsidiary undertaking established in its territory […]). To avoid double
reporting by the subsidiaries and branches of the same third-country undertaking,
Member States may allow for one subsidiary or branch established or located in its
territory to comply with the obligation in Article 40a of the Accounting Directive by
providing a link to the sustainability report published by another Union subsidiary or
branch of the third-country undertaking.
ESRS
44) Which ESRS should be used for the preparation of the sustainability report under
Article 40a of the Accounting Directive?
The sustainability report referred to in Article 40a of the Accounting Directive must be
prepared in accordance with the sustainability reporting standards to be adopted under
Article 40b of the Accounting Directive.
By way of derogation, Article 40a(2) second subparagraph of the Accounting Directive
allows the sustainability report to be prepared in accordance with the sustainability
reporting standards adopted under Article 29b of the Accounting Directive (i.e. ESRS)
or in a manner equivalent to the sustainability reporting standards adopted under Article
29b of the Accounting Directive, as determined by a Commission decision on
equivalence. This provision should be read in the sense that a third-country parent
undertaking falling under the scope of Article 40a of the Accounting Directive may
35
choose to publish a consolidated sustainability statement under Article 29a of the
Accounting Directive (prepared in accordance with the standards adopted under Article
29b), instead of having its EU subsidiary or EU branch publish a sustainability report at
the group level under Article 40a of the Accounting Directive. In that case, the
exemptions for the EU subsidiary set out in Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8) of the
Accounting Directive would apply.
45) What happens if the EU subsidiary/branch does not manage to collect all the
necessary information for the preparation of the sustainability report?
In the event that not all the required information is provided, the subsidiary undertaking
or branch shall draw up, publish and make accessible the sustainability report,
containing all information in its possession, obtained or acquired, and issue a statement
indicating that the third-country undertaking did not make the necessary information
available (Art. 40a(2) fourth subparagraph of the Accounting Directive).
ARTICLE 8 TAXONOMY REGULATION DISCLOSURES
46) Do undertakings have to include Art. 8 Taxonomy Disclosures in the sustainability
report prepared under Article 40a of the Accounting Directive?
No. Undertakings reporting in accordance with Article 40a of the Accounting Directive
do not have to include Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation disclosures in the sustainability
report.
47) If a third-country parent undertaking subject to Article 40a of the Accounting
Directive chooses to prepare and publish a consolidated sustainability statement
prepared in accordance with ESRS instead of a sustainability report, is that third-
country parent undertaking required to report Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation
disclosures?
A third-country parent undertaking subject to Article 40a of the Accounting Directive
that chooses to publish a consolidated sustainability statement prepared in accordance
with ESRS instead of a sustainability report is not required to report under Article 8
Taxonomy Regulation.
However, in order for the Union subsidiaries of that third-country parent to be
exempted from their sustainability reporting requirements under Articles 19a/29a of the
Accounting Directive (where these Union subsidiaries are subject to sustainability
reporting requirements under Articles 19a/29a Accounting Directive), Article 8
Taxonomy Regulation disclosures covering the activities carried out by those Union
subsidiaries must be included in their own management report or in the consolidated
sustainability reporting carried out by the third-country parent undertaking100.
EXEMPTION RULES
100 Article 19a(9) second subparagraph, point (c), and Article 29a(8) second subparagraph, point (c) of the
Accounting Directive.
36
48) Can the Union subsidiaries subject to Article 40a of the Accounting Directive
benefit from the exemption regime under Article 19a(9) and 29(8) of the
Accounting Directive?
The sustainability statement prepared in accordance with Articles 19a/29a of the
Accounting Directive and the sustainability report prepared in accordance with Article
40a of the Accounting Directive have a different content and operate under separate
regimes.
Therefore, a Union subsidiary publishing a sustainability report at the group level of its
third-country parent company according to the provisions of Article 40a does not
exempt the Union subsidiary itself nor its own subsidiaries from complying with the
reporting obligations of Articles 19a and/or 29a.
However, a third-country parent undertaking falling under the scope of Article 40a may
choose to publish a consolidated sustainability statement under Article 29a (prepared in
accordance with the sustainability reporting standards adopted under Article 29b or in a
manner equivalent to those sustainability reporting standards), instead of having its EU
subsidiary or EU branch publish a sustainability report at the group level under Article
40a. In this case, the EU subsidiary is exempted from publishing the sustainability
report under Article 40a, provided that the conditions set out in Articles 19a(9) and
29a(8) are met.
LANGUAGE AND FORMAT
49) In which language should the sustainability report be published?
The linguistic regime for the sustainability report is laid down by each Member State in
accordance with Article 21 of the Company Law Directive.
50) What are the format requirements for the sustainability report to be provided
under Article 40a of the Accounting Directive?
The Accounting Directive does not require a specific format for the publication of the
sustainability report. However, Article 33a – introduced by Directive (EU) 2023/2864
for the functioning of the European Single Access Point (ESAP Omnibus Directive)101
– requires subsidiaries and branches subject to Article 40a to submit to the collection
body designated by the Member State the sustainability report in a data extractable
format together with the relevant accompanying metadata102. The Commission is also
empowered to adopt implementing measures to specify further metadata to accompany
the sustainability report and to require a machine-readable format.
PUBLICATION
51) When should the undertakings/branches publish the sustainability report?
101 Directive (EU) 2023/2864 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2023 amending
certain Directives as regards the establishment and functioning of the European single access point (OJ L,
2023/2864).
102 Article 33a Accounting Directive as amended by the ESAP package.
37
Article 40d(1) of the Accounting Directive requires subsidiary undertakings and
branches referred to in Article 40a(1) of the Accounting Directive to publish the
sustainability report – together with the assurance opinion and, where applicable, the
statement mentioned in the fourth subparagraph of Article 40a(2) of the Accounting
Directive – within 12 months of the balance sheet date of the financial year for which
the report is drawn up.
SUPERVISION
52) Which authorities are in charge of supervising compliance with the requirements
for the sustainability report?
The CSRD does not introduce any changes to the pre-existing sanctioning regime under
the Accounting Directive, which requires Member States to have in place penalties that
are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive for the cases of non-compliance by
undertakings subject to Accounting Directive requirements103. Undertakings’
compliance with sustainability reporting requirements is therefore subject to the
national sanctioning regime in place for the management report of the undertakings
subject to the Accounting Directive. In any case, the sustainability report must be
always subject to assurance by an assurance provider under Article 40a(3) of the
Accounting Directive104.
Section V – FAQs on the assurance of sustainability reporting
APPROVAL OF STATUTORY AUDITORS AND AUDIT FIRMS
53) Shall the natural persons who carry out the statutory audits on behalf of the audit
firm satisfy the conditions imposed by Articles 4 and 6 to 12 of the Audit Directive,
including the additional specific requirements of Articles 7(2), Article 8(3), the
second subparagraph of Article 10(1) and the fourth subparagraph of Article
14(2) of the Audit Directive? Shall the natural persons holding voting rights in an
audit firm satisfy also the conditions imposed by Articles 4 and 6 to 12 of the Audit
Directive, including the additional specific requirements of Articles 7(2), Article
8(3), the second subparagraph of Article 10(1) and the fourth subparagraph of
Article 14(2) of the Audit Directive, even if the audit firm does not plan to provide
assurance of sustainability reporting? What about the requirements for the
natural persons who compose the administrative or management body of the audit
firm?
103 Article 51 Accounting Directive: “Member States shall provide for penalties applicable to infringements of
the national provisions adopted in accordance with this Directive and shall take all the measures necessary to
ensure that those penalties are enforced. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and
dissuasive”.
104 Article 40a(3) first subparagraph: “Member States shall require that the sustainability report […] is
published accompanied by an assurance opinion expressed by one or more person(s) or firm(s) authorised to
give an opinion on the assurance of sustainability reporting under the national law of the third-country
undertaking or of a Member State.”
38
Article 3 of the Audit Directive - regulating the approval of statutory auditors and audit
firms - provides that competent authorities may approve statutory auditors and audit
firms only if certain conditions are met.
The conditions referred to in Article 3(3) of the Audit Directive for the approval of
statutory auditors cross-refer to Articles 4 and 6 to 10 of the Audit Directive, while the
conditions referred to in Article 3(4) of the Audit Directive for the approval of audit
firms cross-refer to Articles 4 and 6 to 12 of the Audit Directive.
The wording of Article 4 of the Audit Directive covering good repute is broad enough
to also apply to the assurance of sustainability reporting, while Articles 6 to 12 of the
Audit Directive have been amended in order to explicitly apply to the assurance of
sustainability reporting.
Where a statutory auditor or audit firm wishes to be approved to provide assurance on
sustainability reporting it will have to comply with all the relevant requirements in
national law transposing the Audit Directive as regards the assurance of sustainability
reporting, including those referred to in Article 3(4) of the Audit Directive. Compliance
with requirements for the assurance of sustainability reporting is not mandatory for the
approval under Article 3 of the Audit Directive of a statutory auditor or audit firm that
does not provide assurance on sustainability reporting.
54) What are the approval requirements for sustainability assurance for statutory
auditors approved before 1 January 2024 or that on 1 January 2024 were
undergoing the approval process?
For statutory auditors to be able to provide assurance of sustainability reporting they
need to be approved and then comply with the additional requirements for
sustainability.
More specifically, based on Article 14a third subparagraph of the Audit Directive, the
statutory auditors approved before 1 January 2026 – that were either approved before 1
January 2024 or that on 1 January 2024 were undergoing the approval process – that
want to carry out also sustainability assurance, do not have to comply with Articles
7(2), 8(3), 10(1) 2nd subparagraph, and 14(2) 4th subparagraph of the Accounting
Directive but still need to acquire the necessary knowledge through continuing
education.
55) Can statutory auditors approved before 1 January 2026 apply indefinitely to be
approved for sustainability assurance? Which requirements would apply for their
approval?
Under Article 14a third subparagraph of the Audit Directive, statutory auditors
approved before 1 January 2026 who wish to carry out the assurance of sustainability
reporting must acquire the necessary knowledge of sustainability reporting and the
assurance of sustainability reporting, including of the subjects listed in Article 8(3) of
the Audit Directive, via the continuing education referred to in Article 13 of the Audit
Directive. Article 14a of the Audit Directive does not require additional examinations
nor the acquisition of this knowledge to be done prior to obtaining the approval. The
Audit Directive does not set out time limits for statutory auditors approved before 1
January 2026 to apply for carrying out sustainability assurance in compliance with
these requirements.
39
56) In order for the statutory auditor or the trainee to also be approved to carry out
the assurance of sustainability reporting, will the three-year practical training
required under Article 10(1) first subparagraph of the Audit Directive need to
include eight months of practical training in the field of sustainability assurance or
will it have to be extended by another eight months?
For the statutory auditor or the trainee to also be approved to carry out the assurance of
sustainability reporting, the three-year practical training required under Article 10(1)
first subparagraph of the Audit Directive will need to include eight months of practical
training on the assurance of annual and consolidated sustainability reporting or on other
sustainability-related services.
The statutory auditor or trainee that has already completed the three-year practical
training at the moment of applying for the approval to carry out assurance of
sustainability reporting will have to perform an additional period of eight months of
practical training on the assurance of annual and consolidated sustainability reporting or
on other sustainability-related services.
Article 14a, first and second subparagraphs of the Audit Directive exempts from this
requirement the following categories of professionals: statutory auditors that are
approved or recognised to carry out statutory audits before 1 January 2024 and persons
that on 1 January 2024 are undergoing the approval process provided they complete
that process by 1 January 2026. Pursuant to Article 14a third subparagraph of the Audit
Directive, these professionals will still need to acquire the necessary knowledge
through continuing education.
57) Under Article 10(1) second subparagraph of the Audit Directive, in order for the
statutory auditor or the trainee to also be approved to carry out the assurance of
sustainability reporting, at least eight months of the practical training referred to
in the first subparagraph shall be on the assurance of annual and consolidated
sustainability reporting or on other sustainability-related services. What is the
correct interpretation of “other sustainability-related services”?
“Other sustainability-related services” should be understood as services related to
sustainability reporting other than assurance. They could encompass, for example,
consulting services on sustainability reports and the preparation of sustainability
reports.
58) Can a statutory auditor approved to carry out statutory audits before 1 January
2024 in Member State A be approved to carry out the assurance of sustainability
reporting in Member State B, even though that statutory auditor is not approved
to carry out the assurance of sustainability reporting in Member State A? For the
registration in Member State B, does this auditor need to be registered as
statutory auditor and as assurance service provider or can this auditor only be
registered as assurance service provider?
For the registration in Member State B, the statutory auditor needs to be approved as a
statutory auditor in that Member State (see Articles 3(1) and 14(1) of the Audit
Directive). If that is the case and the auditor wishes to be registered as an assurance
services provider, the transitional regime under Article 14a of the Audit Directive will
apply in Member State B (see also FAQ 54). Approval as an assurance services
provider in Member State A is not required.
40
59) A statutory auditor approved to carry out statutory audits after 1 January 2024 in
Member State A, and who is also approved to carry out the assurance of
sustainability reporting in that Member State, wants to be registered in Member
State B. In this case does the statutory auditor need to be registered in Member
State B as auditor and as assurance service provider or could this statutory
auditor be registered only as assurance service provider?
The statutory auditor should be registered as a statutory auditor and as assurance
services provider in Member State B. The only entities that can be registered as
assurance services providers without being auditors are the Independent Assurance
Services Providers (IASPs).
ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE
SERVICES PROVIDERS (IASPS)
60) Can natural persons be accredited as Independent Assurance Services Providers
(IASPs)?
Yes. Article 2 point (23) of the Audit Directive and Article 2 point (20) of the
Accounting Directive define IASPs as “a conformity assessment body accredited in
accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the
Council for the specific conformity assessment activity referred to in point (aa) of the
second subparagraph of Article 34(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU”. Regulation No
765/2008 also defines the conformity assessment body as “a body that performs
conformity assessment activities including calibration, testing, certification and
inspection”.
While Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 only refers to the accreditation of bodies, it is to
be recalled that IASPs are not within the intended scope of that Regulation. The term
“body” should be read as to include the case of natural persons to ensure a level playing
field between IASPs and statutory auditors.
61) IASPs established in a Member State can carry out the assurance of sustainability
reporting in that territory, provided that they are subject to requirements
equivalent to those set out in the Audit Directive. Does the equivalence of the
requirements need to cover also Article 3a of the Audit Directive?
Article 34(4) of the Accounting Directive requires IASPs to comply with requirements
equivalent to the ones in the Audit Directive for them to be able to carry out
sustainability assurance. These requirements include the non-exhaustive list set out in
Article 34(4) of the Accounting Directive and an equivalence assessment with the
assurance of sustainability reporting as defined in Article 2, point (22) of the Audit
Directive.
To ensure the level playing field between IASPs and statutory auditors, IASPs should
also comply with registration requirements equivalent to those set out in Article 3a of
the Audit Directive.
ACCREDITED INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY
41
62) What is the "accredited independent third party" referred to in Articles 34(6) of
the Accounting Directive and 37(3) of the Audit Directive?
Recital (63) CSRD reads “Member States should ensure that when an undertaking is
required by Union law to have elements of its sustainability reporting verified by an
accredited independent third party, the report of the accredited independent third party
should be made available either as an annex to the management report or by any other
publicly accessible means. Such making available of that report should not pre-empt
the outcome of the assurance opinion of which the third-party verification should
remain independent. It should not entail any duplication of work between the auditor or
the independent assurance services provider that expresses the assurance opinion and
the accredited independent third party.”
An “accredited independent third party” is an entity, usually an expert other than the
statutory auditor or Independent Assurance Services Provider (IASP), providing the
assurance opinion on the sustainability statement, that might verify parts of the
sustainability reporting, such as GHG emissions. The CSRD requires transparency as
regards the results of its work and non-duplication with the work of the statutory
auditors/IASPs105.
INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE SERVICES PROVIDERS (IASPS)
63) Will an Independent Assurance Services Provider (IASP) established in the
territory of another Member State be able to perform tasks in a Member State
that does not allow IASPs to carry out assurance on sustainability reporting in its
territory?
No. An IASP established in the territory of another Member State will not be able to
provide assurance on sustainability reporting in a Member State that does not allow
IASPs to carry out assurance on sustainability reporting in its territory.
Article 34(4) first subparagraph of the Accounting Directive provides Member States
with the option to allow IASPs established in their territory to express the assurance
opinion on sustainability reporting, provided that these IASPs are subject to
requirements equivalent to those set out by the Audit Directive for statutory auditors
that carry out the assurance of sustainability reporting. Article 34(5) first subparagraph
of the Accounting Directive requires only Member States that have made use of this
option to allow IASPs established in another Member State to carry out the assurance
of sustainability reporting in their territory.
64) If the IASP is established in a different Member State, who will have supervisory
powers for the work performed by the IASP?
Where the IASP carries out the assurance of sustainability reporting in the territory of
another Member State (host Member State), the Member State where the IASP is
established (home Member State) should be responsible for supervising the work of the
IASP unless the host Member State decides to supervise the assurance of sustainability
reporting carried out by IASPs in its territory106. If the host Member State decides to
supervise the assurance of sustainability reporting carried out in its territory by IASPs
105 Article 34(6) of the Accounting Directive and 37(3) second subparagraph of the Audit Directive.
106 Article 34(5) of the Accounting Directive.
42
registered in another Member State, the host Member State shall: (i) not impose more
stringent requirements or liability on such IASPs than those required for assurance of
sustainability reporting by the national laws for the IASPs or auditors established in that
host Member State; and (ii) inform other Member States about its decision to supervise
the assurance of sustainability reporting carried out by IASPs established in other
Member States.
65) Once a Member State has allowed IASPs to be established on its territory, are
national undertakings automatically allowed to resort to IASPs to carry out the
assurance on sustainability reporting?
Yes, undertakings will be allowed to resort to IASPs for the assurance of their
sustainability statement once a Member State has allowed IASPs to carry out the
assurance on sustainability reporting.
THIRD-COUNTRY ASSURANCE PROVIDERS
66) Can third-country Independent Assurance Services Providers (IASPs) provide
sustainability assurance in the Union?
Based on Article 34(4) of the Accounting Directive, the IASPs established in the
territory of a Member State may be allowed to provide the assurance of sustainability
reporting.
The definition of IASP under Article 2 point (23) of the Audit Directive and Article 2
point (20) of the Accounting Directive requires its accreditation pursuant to Regulation
765/2008. While that Regulation only refers to the accreditation of bodies that are
established in the territory of a Member State, it is to be recalled that IASPs are not
within the intended scope of that Regulation. IASPs are carrying out assurance services
for sustainability reporting. Hence, the scheme for authorisation of IASPs has to be
interpreted in the light of the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services of the
World Trade Organisation) commitments of the Member States and of the Union’s
bilateral agreements. Consequently, in the context of IASPs, Regulation 765/2008 has
to be interpreted in such a way that third-country IASPs are allowed to provide the
assurance of sustainability reporting in accordance with Member States’s commitments.
CONFIDENTIALITY
67) Are confidentiality requirements in Article 23 of the Audit Directive also
applicable to professionals performing the assurance of sustainability reporting?
Yes. Confidentiality requirements in Article 23 of the Audit Directive are also
applicable to professionals performing the assurance of sustainability reporting. Where
the Member State has allowed an IASP or a statutory auditor other than the one
auditing the financial statements to perform the assurance of sustainability reporting,
these assurance providers should be able to exchange information to appropriately
coordinate.
43
ASSURANCE SERVICES
68) What is the meaning of the term “sustainability analysis” used in Article 8(3)
point (b) of the Audit Directive?
The term “sustainability analysis” was used as a parallel to “financial analysis” from
the Audit Directive for statutory auditors. While “financial analysis” refers to an
assessment of the viability, stability, and profitability of a business, sub-business or
project, “sustainability analysis” should be considered as an assessment of the
sustainability matters affecting a business and sustainability matters on which the
business may have an impact.
FEES
69) Would it be considered a breach of Article 25 of the Audit Directive if the fees for
the assurance of sustainability reporting are lowered in the case the same
statutory auditor also performs the statutory audit?
Article 25 of the Audit Directive requires Member States to ensure that fees for
statutory audits and the assurance of sustainability reporting are not influenced or
determined by the provision of “additional services” provided to the audited entity,
which should be intended as “services other than the statutory audit and assurance of
sustainability reporting”. It does not regulate the relationship between the fees for
statutory audits and assurance of sustainability reporting.
ASSURANCE OF THE SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT PREPARED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 19a AND 29a ACCOUNTING DIRECTIVE
70) What should the assurance provider express an opinion on, according to Article
34(1) of the Accounting Directive?
Under Article 34(1) second subparagraph, point (aa) of the Accounting Directive, any
undertaking subject to sustainability reporting under Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive must obtain an assurance opinion on their sustainability
statement.
This assurance opinion is based on a limited assurance engagement as regards the
compliance of the sustainability statement with the following requirements:
− the sustainability reporting requirements provided for in the Accounting Directive
(including the compliance of the sustainability reporting with the ESRS adopted
pursuant to Articles 29b/29c of the Accounting Directive, the process carried out
by the undertaking to identify the information reported pursuant to those ESRS -
i.e., the double materiality assessment process, and the compliance with the
requirement to mark-up sustainability reporting in accordance with Article 29d of
the Accounting Directive); and
− the reporting requirements provided for in Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.
The assurance providers are expected to perform procedures that enable them to
conclude that no matter has come to their attention to cause them to believe that the
information included in the sustainability statement is not fairly presented, in all
material respects, in accordance with ESRS as adopted by the Union and that it is not
44
compliant with the legal requirements to mark-up sustainability information (i.e., the
digital tagging) and with the legal requirements of Article 8 of the Taxonomy
Regulation.
The first part of the conclusion referring to the fair presentation, in all material respects,
in accordance with the ESRS entails an opinion on:
− whether the undertaking’s sustainability statement, including the process to
identify the information reported (i.e., the double materiality assessment
process), are compliant with ESRS; and
− whether the outcome of this process has resulted in the disclosure of all material
sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities of the undertaking in
accordance with ESRS.
71) Paragraph 121 ESRS 1 (General requirements) allows the undertaking to
incorporate information in its sustainability statement by reference to its report
prepared according to EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
Regulation (EU) No 1221/2009. This provision is subject to the conditions of
paragraph 120, including that the information incorporated by reference is
subject to at least the same level of assurance as the sustainability statement. Is the
undertaking’s report prepared according to EU Eco-Management and Audit
Scheme (EMAS) Regulation (EU) No 1221/2009 subject to at least the same level of
assurance as the sustainability statement?
Under Article 34(1) second subparagraph, point (aa) of the Accounting Directive, any
undertaking subject to sustainability reporting under Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive must obtain an assurance opinion based on a limited assurance
engagement. The undertaking’s report prepared according to EU Eco-Management and
Audit Scheme (EMAS) Regulation (EU) No 1221/2009 is subject to a validation
performed by an environmental verifier and this validation can be considered to be at
least at the same level of assurance as the CSRD limited assurance requirement.
72) In the case of two different statutory auditors carrying out the audit of the
financial statements and the assurance of the sustainability statement, which one
of the two should express the opinion on whether the management report is
consistent with the financial statements?
Based on Article 34(1), second subparagraph, point (a)(i) of the Accounting Directive,
the statutory auditor or audit firm carrying out the statutory audit of financial statements
has to express an opinion on whether the management report is consistent with the
financial statements for the same financial year. When a statutory auditor or an audit
firm other than the one(s) carrying out the statutory audit of financial statements is in
charge of expressing the assurance opinion on sustainability reporting, the statutory
auditor or audit firm in charge of auditing the financial statements remains in charge of
expressing an opinion on the consistency between management report and financial
statements for the same financial year.
73) In which document does the assurance opinion need to be included?
45
In the assurance report107. If the assurance opinion is given by the same auditor that
does the audit of financial statements, Member States may allow auditors to include the
assurance opinion as a separate section of the audit report.
74) How should the assurance report be published? Are there any format
requirements for the assurance report?
Union law does not currently require a specific format for the audit report and/or its
signature. However, Article 33a of the Accounting Directive as amended by the ESAP
package, requires undertakings to submit the assurance report to the relevant ESAP
collection body when they make it public and to use a data extractable format (or a
machine-readable format, where required by Union or national law), together with the
relevant accompanying metadata. The Commission is also empowered to adopt
implementing measures to specify further metadata to accompany the assurance report
and to require a machine-readable format.
75) What assurance standards should be used by assurance providers of the
sustainability statement pending the adoption of assurance standards by the
European Commission?
Based on Article 26(1) second subparagraph of the Audit Directive, Member States
may apply national auditing standards, procedures or requirements as long as the
Commission has not adopted an international auditing standard covering the same
subject matter.
Given the qualitative characteristics of information required under ESRS 1 (Chapter 2
and Appendix B: relevance and faithful representation as well as comparability,
verifiability and understandability) and in order to avoid fragmentation and ensure that
practices are as consistent as possible during this transitional period, pending the
adoption of Union assurance standards, the Commission has requested the Committee
of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEAOB) to develop in 2024 non-binding
guidelines for statutory auditors and other assurance services providers.
76) Would it be possible for Member States to allow undertakings subject to CSRD
requirements to assign, on a voluntary basis, an engagement to express an opinion
based on a mixed form of assurance (i.e. a limited assurance on parts of the
sustainability reporting and a reasonable assurance on other parts of the
reporting – for example on specific key performance indicators)?
Based on Article 34(1), second subparagraph, point (aa) of the Accounting Directive,
the assurance opinion on the sustainability reporting has to be based on a limited
assurance engagement108. Considering that a reasonable assurance engagement provides
for a higher level of assurance compared to a limited assurance engagement, the CSRD
does not prevent an undertaking from deciding voluntarily to ask for an opinion based
on reasonable assurance on the whole sustainability reporting or parts of it. This
decision would be for the undertaking and not for the assurance provider.
107 Article 28a Audit Directive.
108 Based on Article 26a Audit Directive, the Commission is empowered to adopt sustainability assurance
standards for limited assurance by 1 October 2026. The Commission is also empowered to adopt sustainability
assurance standards for reasonable assurance by 1 October 2028, following an assessment to determine if
reasonable assurance is feasible for auditors and for undertakings.
46
77) Shall undertakings that report sustainability information in accordance with
ESRS on a voluntary basis (such as SMEs without securities admitted to trading
on an EU regulated market) be required to subject this information to assurance?
The CSRD does not regulate sustainability reporting carried out on a voluntary basis.
An undertaking carrying out sustainability reporting on a voluntary basis is therefore
not required to subject its sustainability information to an assurance engagement.
NON-ASSURANCE SERVICES
78) What are the non-audit service restrictions when a statutory auditor provides
CSRD assurance services to an entity or group that is not a financial statement
audit client?
Under Article 25c(1) of the Audit Directive, a statutory auditor or an audit firm
carrying out the assurance of sustainability reporting of a Public Interest Entity (PIE) -
or a member of the network - shall not provide to the PIE the prohibited non-audit
services referred to in Article 5(1) second subparagraph, points (b), (c), (e) to (k) of the
Audit Regulation.
Under Article 25c(2) of the Audit Directive, that statutory auditor or audit firm may
provide to the PIE non-audit services other than:
− the prohibited non-audit services referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article; or
− if applicable (i.e. where the statutory auditor also carries out audits of financial
statements), the prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) second
subparagraph of the Audit Regulation; or
− services considered by Member States to represent a threat to independence as
referred to in Article 5(2) of that Regulation, subject to the approval of the audit
committee after it has properly assessed threats to independence and the
safeguards applied in accordance with Article 22b of the Audit Directive.
Therefore:
− when the audit firm carries out only the assurance of sustainability reporting of a
PIE, it may provide non-audit services other than the prohibited ones referred to
in Article 5(1) second subparagraph point (b), (c) and (e) to (k) of the Audit
Regulation (since the latter pose a risk to the independence of the audit firm in
case of carrying out the assurance of sustainability reporting);
− when the audit firm carries both the statutory audit and the assurance of
sustainability reporting of a given PIE, it may provide non-audit services other
than the prohibited ones referred to in Article 5(1) second subparagraph of the
Audit Regulation (i.e. the prohibited services referred to in all points (a) to (k)
because these services pose the risk to the independence of the audit firm in case
of both: the assurance of sustainability reporting – points (b), (c) and (e) to (k)
and the statutory audit – points (a) to (k)).
ASSURANCE OF THE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT PREPARED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 40a OF THE ACCOUNTING DIRECTIVE
47
79) What happens if the third-country undertaking does not provide the assurance
opinion to the EU subsidiary/EU branch?
Pursuant to Article 40a(3) of the Accounting Directive, if the third-country undertaking
does not provide the assurance opinion, the subsidiary undertaking or branch shall issue
a statement indicating that fact.
80) How should the assurance opinion for the sustainability report prepared pursuant
to Article 40a of the Accounting Directive be published? Are there any format
requirements?
Based on Article 40d(1) of the Accounting Directive, the assurance opinion for the
sustainability report prepared pursuant to Article 40a shall be published together with
the sustainability report – and, where applicable, the statement mentioned in the fourth
subparagraph of Article 40a(2) of the Accounting Directive – within 12 months of the
balance sheet date of the financial year for which the report is drawn up, as provided for
by each Member State, in accordance with Articles 14 to 28 of the Company Law
Directive and, where relevant, in accordance with Article 36 of that Directive. Union
law does not currently require specific format requirements for the assurance opinion.
However, Article 33a of the Accounting Directive - introduced by the ESAP package
109 - requires subsidiaries and branches subject to Article 40a of the Accounting
Directive to submit the sustainability report to the collection body designated by the
Member State in a data extractable format together with the relevant accompanying
metadata. The Commission is also empowered to adopt implementing measures to
specify further metadata to accompany the assurance opinion and to require a machine-
readable format.
Section VI – FAQs on key intangible resources
81) According to Article 19(1) fourth subparagraph of the Accounting Directive,
undertakings shall report information on the key intangible resources and explain
how the business model of the undertaking fundamentally depends on such
resources and how such resources are a source of value creation for the
undertaking. Does this disclosure requirement apply to all kinds of key intangible
resources, including intangible assets recognised on the balance sheet?
Article 19(1) fourth subparagraph of the Accounting Directive is not limited to
information about key intangible resources that are not recognised as intangible assets
on the balance sheet. Consequently, the requirement applies to all key intangible
resources of the undertaking, including intangible assets recognised on the balance
sheet.
This holistic approach allows users to understand the dependencies of the undertaking’s
business model on key intangible resources and their relevance for the company’s value
creation, irrespective of whether they would meet the recognition and measurement
criteria of the applicable accounting framework. It will help users to assess the
undertaking’s market value.
109 In particular by Directive (EU) 2023/2864 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December
2023 amending certain Directives as regards the establishment and functioning of the European single access
point (OJ L, 2023/2864) “ESAP Omnibus Directive”.
48
82) Which entities are required to provide information on key intangible resources in
the management report? Shall this requirement also apply to credit institutions
and insurance undertaking, irrespective of their legal form?
Large undertakings and listed SMEs (except micro-undertakings) shall report
information on the key intangible resources and explain how the business model of the
undertaking fundamentally depends on such resources and how such resources are a
source of value creation for the undertaking. Article 19 of the Accounting Directive
only applies to the types of undertakings referred to in Article 1(1) of the Accounting
Directive, including credit institutions and insurance undertakings that fulfil the
conditions in Article 1(1) of the Accounting Directive. This information must be
included in the management report (but not necessarily in the sustainability statement).
83) Do key intangible resources have to be included in the sustainability statement?
Article 19(1) of the Accounting Directive sets out information which must be included
in the undertaking’s management report. Article 19(1) fourth subparagraph of the
Accounting Directive requires information concerning key intangible resources to be
included in the management report. Therefore, this information does not necessarily
have to be included in the sustainability statement and may be provided in a different
section of the management report.
Section VII – Additional FAQs on requirements for third-country undertakings
84) Are third-country undertakings required to report sustainability information at
individual and/or consolidated level (individual/consolidated sustainability
statement) under Articles 19a/29a of the Accounting Directive?
Without prejudice to Article 23 of the Transparency Directive, third-country
undertakings are required to report sustainability information at individual and/or
consolidated level under Articles 19a/29a of the Accounting Directive, but only if the
third-country undertaking is an issuer of transferable securities admitted to trading on
an EU regulated market, excluding micro-undertakings.
Third-country issuers must include sustainability information within their management
report as part of their annual financial report, based on Article 4(5) of the Transparency
Directive, which cross-refers to Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive.
85) Can third-country SMEs with transferable securities admitted to trading on an
EU regulated market opt out from the obligation to report sustainability
information for financial years starting before 1 January 2028 pursuant to Article
19a(7) of the Accounting Directive?
Yes, the opt-out provision set out in Article 19a(7) of the Accounting Directive also
applies to third-country SMEs with transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU
regulated market (see FAQ 16).
49
86) If a third-country parent undertaking publishes on a voluntary basis a
consolidated sustainability statement to allow its subsidiaries to avail of the
exemptions under Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8) of the Accounting Directive, does that
consolidated sustainability statement need to be included in a consolidated
management report or can it be a standalone document?
The third-country parent undertaking that complies with Article 29a of the Accounting
Directive on a voluntary basis may include the consolidated sustainability statement in
a separate document.
87) Does the consolidated sustainability statement of the third-country parent
undertaking prepared pursuant to Article 29a of the Accounting Directive have to
include all its subsidiaries or only the EU subsidiaries?
The rules for the consolidation of the sustainability statement are the same ones as for
the consolidation of the financial statements. Based on Article 22(6) of the Accounting
Directive110, the consolidated sustainability statement must include all its subsidiary
undertakings, regardless of where the registered offices of such subsidiary undertakings
are situated.
88) Pending a Commission decision on the equivalence of third-country sustainability
standards, how can a third-country undertaking that is not required to report
sustainability information under Union law allow its Union subsidiaries to be
exempted from sustainability reporting under Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive?
A third-country undertaking that is not required to report sustainability information
under Union law and that wants to allow its Union subsidiaries to be exempted from
sustainability reporting under Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive may
publish a consolidated sustainability statement prepared in accordance with ESRS.
Alternatively, based on Article 48i(1) of the Accounting Directive, until financial years
ending on 6 January 2030, Member States must allow a subsidiary governed by the law
of a Member State that is subject to Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive
and whose parent undertaking is governed by the law of a third-country to prepare and
publish a consolidated sustainability statement under Article 29a of the Accounting
Directive, that includes all Union direct or indirect subsidiary undertakings of such
third-country parent undertaking that are subject to Articles 19a and 29a of the
Accounting Directive. Article 48i(2) of the Accounting Directive specifies that the
Union subsidiary undertaking preparing the consolidated sustainability reporting shall
be one of the Union subsidiary undertakings of the group that generated the greatest
turnover in the Union in at least one of the preceding five financial years, on a
consolidated basis where applicable.
Based on Article 48i(3) of the Accounting Directive, the preparation and publication of
the consolidated sustainability statement prepared and published by the Union
subsidiary referred to in Article 48i(1) of the Accounting Directive leads to the
exemption from sustainability reporting of all undertakings included in the
consolidation, provided that the conditions in Articles 19a(9) and 29a(8) are met.
110 Article 22(6) Accounting Directive: “Without prejudice to Article 23(9), a parent undertaking and all of its
subsidiary undertakings shall be undertakings to be consolidated regardless of where the registered offices of
such subsidiary undertakings are situated.”
50
89) Do third-country issuers have to include Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation
disclosures in their sustainability statement?
Without prejudice to Article 23 of the Transparency Directive, third-country issuers
reporting in accordance with Article 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive must
include Article 8 Taxonomy disclosures in their sustainability statements.
Article 4(5) of the Transparency Directive requires EU and third-country issuers of
transferable securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market (excluding micro-
undertakings) to draw up their management report in accordance with Articles 19, 19a,
20, and 29d(1) of the Accounting Directive (or Articles 29, 29a and 29d(2) of the
Accounting Directive in the case of a consolidated management report) and to include
the specifications adopted pursuant to Article 8(4) Taxonomy Regulation, “when drawn
up by undertakings referred to in those provisions”.
In line with the co-legislators’ clear intention to extend the sustainability reporting
requirements set out in the Accounting Directive (which only applies to EU
undertakings) to EU and third-country issuers, “when drawn up by undertakings
referred to in those provisions” is to be interpreted as referring to the categories of
undertakings referred to in Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive (i.e. large
undertakings, listed SMEs excluding micro-undertakings, and parent companies of
large groups). Since the Transparency Directive applies to all EU and third-country
issuers (including micro-undertakings), this sentence is needed to ensure that listed
micro-undertakings are not subject to sustainability reporting requirements.
Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation requires companies subject to Articles 19a or
29a of the Accounting Directive to publish how and to what extent the company’s
activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally
sustainable. The wording of Article 4(5) of the Transparency Directive indicates that
where an EU or third-country issuer is subject to sustainability reporting requirements
under Articles 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive, it must include Article 8
Taxonomy Regulation disclosures in its management report.
Section VIII – FAQ on SFDR
90) May financial market participants assume that any indicator reported as non-
material by an investee undertaking subject to the CSRD does not contribute to
the corresponding indicator of principal adverse impacts in the context of the
SFDR disclosures?
Yes. Financial market participants may assume that any indicator reported as non-
material by an investee company applying ESRS does not contribute to the
corresponding indicator of principal adverse impacts in the context of the SFDR
disclosures, i.e. the value of that investment does not need to be included in the
numerator of the given SFDR principal adverse impact indicator.
Article 29b(5) point (b) of the Accounting Directive requires the Commission, to the
greatest extent possible, to take account of the information that financial market
participants need to comply with their disclosure obligations laid down in Regulation
(EU) 2019/2088 and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to that Regulation when
adopting sustainability reporting standards.
As a consequence of the obligation set out in the CSRD to take into account the
information needs of financial market participants, any indicator reported as non-
51
material by an investee undertaking subject to the CSRD requirements is relevant
information and may be considered as not contributing to principal adverse impacts
under the SFDR.
Financial market participants will find this information in CSRD reporting as ESRS 1
paragraph 35 requires that when an undertaking considers that a specific datapoint
derived from the SFDR is not material, the undertaking explicitly states that the
information in question is “not material”111.
In addition, ESRS 2, paragraph 56 requires undertakings subject to the CSRD to
include a table of all the datapoints that derive from other EU legislation, including the
SFDR, indicating where they can be found in the sustainability statement and indicating
“Not material” in the table for those that the undertaking has assessed as not material,
in accordance with ESRS 1 paragraph 35.
111 The same approach is taken for datapoints that derive from other EU legislation listed in Appendix B of
ESRS 2.
52
