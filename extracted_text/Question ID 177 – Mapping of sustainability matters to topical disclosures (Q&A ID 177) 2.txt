Disclosure Requirements
Release date
November 2024
Question asked
Is there a mapping link between the sustainability matters listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 and the
Disclosure Requirements in the topical standards or must judgement be used in deciding the
disclosures required for a material sustainability matter?
Key terms
Mapping sustainability matters; Disclosure Requirements
ESRS reference
ESRS 1 paragraphs 25, 30, and AR 16
Background
ESRS 1 paragraph 25 states: ‘Performing a materiality assessment (see sections 3.4 Impact materiality
and 3.5 Financial materiality) is necessary for the undertaking to identify the material impacts, risk and
opportunities to be reported.’
ESRS 1 paragraph 30 states: ‘When the undertaking concludes that a sustainability matter is material
as a result of its materiality assessment on which ESRS 2 IRO-1, IRO-2 and SBM-3 set Disclosure
Requirements, it shall:
(a) disclose information according to the Disclosure Requirements (including Application
Requirements) related to that specific sustainability matter in the corresponding topical and
sector-specific ESRS’.
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 (containing a list of sustainability matters) states: ‘When performing its
materiality assessment, the undertaking shall consider the following list of sustainability matters
covered in the topical ESRS. When, as a result of the undertaking’s materiality assessment (see ESRS 2
IRO-1), a given sustainability matter in this list is assessed to be material, the undertaking shall report
according to the corresponding Disclosure Requirements of the relevant topical ESRS.’
IG 1 Materiality Assessment paragraphs 77 and 78 state:
‘77. The process of identification of the potential matters may start with the screening of the list of
matters summarised in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 and then be complemented with additional
entity-specific matters …
78. The undertaking may also develop a “long” list of impacts, risks and opportunities relevant to its
business model and upstream / downstream value chain and aggregate them following the
Page 4 of 23
structure provided in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 …Then, the undertaking could compare the
matters identified with the list in ESRS 1 AR 16 for completeness. The two approaches may be
combined.’
Disclaimer on how to use this mapping
This explanation is not intended to be used as a tool to support the assessment of the materiality of
sustainable topics (or matters), but it can be helpful once the material matters have been determined
to support preparers to identify the Disclosure Requirements and datapoints that are linked to the
matters (topics, subtopics and sub-subtopics) assessed as being material.
ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 shall be considered when performing the materiality assessment. The
materiality of each subtopic or sub-subtopic should not necessarily be assessed, when at the related
topical level, the entire topic is assessed as not material, respectively; the materiality of each sub-
subtopic should not necessarily be assessed when at the related sub-topic level, the entire sub-topic is
assessed as not material. This is also to say that topics, subtopic or sub-subtopics shall be assessed as
not material when no material impacts, risks or opportunities are identified within them.
If the undertaking has assessed entity-specific matters not listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 as material,
then ESRS 1 paragraphs 11 and 30 (b), AR 1 to 5 and ESRS 1 Chapter 10.1 apply (see also IG 1 Materiality
Assessment Chapter 4 How can other sources be leveraged?).
The mapping in this explanation does not imply an automatism relating to the conclusion on the
materiality of a metric when the related matter has been deemed material. It is still possible for the
undertaking to conclude that a metric is not material to itself despite it pertaining to a material matter.
Conversely, some metrics may be related to more than one subtopic. The assessment of the materiality
of information requires the exercise of judgment.
The mapping in this explanation is based on the assumption that the relationship between sustainability
matters across two different topical ESRS (for instance, the relationship of Climate Change and
Biodiversity, or the relationship between Biodiversity and Affected communities) or the relationship
between sustainability matters within one topic (for instance, the relationship between Climate change
adaptation and Energy – (both ESRS E1), or the relationship between Collective Bargaining and
adequate wages – (both ESRS S1)) have been evidenced by the undertaking at the level of the
materiality assessment and that such interrelations will be reflected when assessing the materiality of
information. For example, if an undertaking has identified negative material impacts related to ESRS S3
Affected Communities due to negative material impacts on ESRS E4 Biodiversity connected to the
undertaking, this relationship would be identified when performing the materiality assessment
described in ESRS 2 IRO-1. Another example is where pollution of water (ESRS E2) limits the availability
of clean water (ESRS E3) and poses a threat to the state of ecosystems (ESRS E4) and water and
sanitation access from communities (ESRS S3). Those links may influence the preparers’ approach to
identifying interrelated Disclosure Requirements when performing the materiality assessment as per
ESRS 2 IRO-1.
Answer
If a sustainability matter (i.e. topic, subtopic or sub-subtopic) listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 is
assessed as being material given that a material impact, risk or opportunity has been identified for that
matter, the general process to determine the information to disclose can be described as follows:
(a) for policies, actions and targets the undertaking shall include the information required by the
corresponding Disclosure Requirements in topical standards as well as the information
required by ESRS 2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements on policies, actions and targets in
compliance with ESRS 1 paragraph 33;
Page 5 of 23
(b) For metrics, the undertaking shall assess the materiality of information in compliance with
ESRS 1 paragraph 31 and 34. Assessing the materiality of information helps determine which
metrics (or which datapoints of metrics Disclosure Requirements) are material and as such
should be disclosed. if a Disclosure Requirement contains a number of metrics datapoints, the
undertaking may conclude that one or more of those datapoints are not material given its
specific facts and circumstances (for example ESRS E2 Disclosure Requirement E2-4 - Pollution
of air, water and soil that contain a number of datapoints).
To support the application of ESRS 1 paragraph 30, this explanation articulates the relationship
between the sustainability matters described in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16, and the Disclosure
Requirements in the topical standards. In addition to disclosing information from topical ESRS, the
undertaking shall also include entity-specific information when this is necessary (ESRS 1 paragraph 11).
This explanation includes a flowchart, narrative content and mapping tables.
The mapping is aimed at supporting undertakings in determining the Disclosure Requirements
(including the associated Application Requirements for such disclosures; refer to EFRAG’s IG3, ‘List of
ESRS datapoints for a detailed mapping’) related to a specific material sustainability matter in the
corresponding topical ESRS as required in ESRS 1 paragraph 30.
The mapping tables cover the topical standards. They do not include:
(a) ESRS 1 General Requirements;
(b) ESRS 2 General Disclosures, as ESRS 2 disclosures are to be disclosed irrespective of the
outcome of the materiality assessment (ESRS 1 paragraph 29). By extension, they do not
include the ESRS 2 IRO-1related disclosures that are included in the topical standards (refer
to the environmental topics), for which the treatment specified in ESRS 2 paragraph 2 is
applicable.; or
(c) entity-specific (and sector-specific) matters whereby the undertaking shall add metrics if it
concludes that ‘an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient
granularity by an ESRS but is material due to specific facts and circumstances’ (refer to ESRS
1 paragraph 11 and 30 (b)).
For metrics, which can be either quantitative or qualitative, there is no systematic ‘one-to-one’
relationship between a matter (as captured by ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16) and a topical Disclosure
Requirement.
Some metrics provide information that support the understanding of any of the related subtopics or sub-
subtopics in a topical standard. This is the case, for instance, for ESRS S1-6 and S1-7 on the
characteristics of own workforce or S1-17 on incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts
where own workforce or any related subtopic or sub-subtopic is assessed to be material for the
undertaking.
Some metrics are directly related to one specific subtopic or sub- subtopic. This is the case, for instance,
for:
(a) the subtopic Management of relationships with suppliers including payment practices,
which is related to ESRS G1-6 Payment practice;
(b) many sub-subtopics of ESRS S1, which are directly covered by specific Disclosure
Requirements. For instance, the sub-subtopic health and safety is directly related to the
Disclosure Requirement S1-14 Health and safety; and
(c) the subtopic Microplastics for which the relevant metric is embedded in the broader
Disclosure Requirement ESRS E2-4 Pollution of air, water and soil.
Page 6 of 23
The social standards ESRS S2 to S4 do not have standardised metrics beyond the Disclosure
Requirements of policies, actions and targets nor do the corresponding provisions in ESRS 2 MDR-P,
MDR-A, or MDR-T.
The mapping in this document takes these differences of architecture of topical standards into
account. It provides an overview of the direct links that exist between matters and Disclosure
Requirements or datapoints where such direct links exist.
The mapping of ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 to Disclosure Requirements does not link matters addressed
in datapoints except in the case where subtopics or sub-subtopics are directly mentioned in a
datapoint (and not in the title of the Disclosure Requirements). This is the case, for instance, for
microplastics in ESRS E2, for water withdrawals and water discharges in ESRS E3 or for waste in ESRS E5.
Fig 1: Flowchart for determining the Disclosure Requirements once the material sustainability matters
from ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 have been identified (to note: this flowchart does not cover entity-specific
metrics disclosures)
Mapping tables
The tables below map ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 to the respective ESRS Disclosure Requirements. They do
not cover information regarding where in the sustainability statement the information shall be
disclosed.
The mapping is only meant to direct links from a subtopic in AR 16 to DRs in topical ESRS. It is to be
noted that sustainability matters in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 are often interrelated. Based on the facts
and circumstances of an undertaking, the materiality of a specific subtopic or sub-subtopic of a topical
ESRS can trigger reporting requirements in other topical ESRS (please refer to the Disclaimer section of
this explanation).
In this Section, we illustrate the disclosure requirement that are connected to a specific matter/topic,
i.e. that have to be considered in the assessment performed under paragraph 34 of ESRS 1 when a
given matter/topic is material, in order to ultimately determine which datapoints are reported.
E1 Climate Change
The following can be noted:
Page 7 of 23
(a) The subtopics of energy and climate change mitigation are closely linked. The datapoints in the
Disclosure Requirement E5-1 Energy Consumption and mix cover aspects (energy use) linked
to climate change mitigation; therefore they are connected to climate change mitigation
(b) E1-1 Transition plan is connected to climate change mitigation
(c) Disclosure Requirements or datapoints regarding financial resilience (ESRS paragraphs to be
included) are connected to both climate change mitigation and adaptation
(d) E1-7 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits is not
expected to be disclosed unless the undertaking uses such financing tools
(e) E1-8 Internal carbon pricing is expected to be disclosed only when the undertaking has
implemented such mechanism.

S1 to S4 Policies, Actions and Targets (PAT) and Processes
The table below maps ESRS paragraph AR 16 matters (topic, sub- and sub-subtopics) to ESRS S1 to S4
Disclosure requirements related to policies, actions and targets and processes.
S1 Own workforce
The topic covers fundamental rights that are classified as sub-subtopics in ESRS S1 and
ESRS S2 which are interconnected. Such connections are not explicit in the ESRS S1 and
are presented in the table below. When mapping the disclosures to report, the sub-
subtopics and/or metrics related to fundamental rights should be considered when
determining what to disclose if the topic own workforce is considered material (refer to
the table below), as they cover different aspects of the matter own workforce, and as
such, they all relate to own workforce as a topic.
In addition, the metrics on S1-6, S1-7 and S1-17 are mapped to the own workforce directly. In the case
of S1-6 and S1-7, these provide contextual information that supports the understanding of the
information reported in the other ESRS S1 disclosures, and they form the basis for calculation of other
metrics, as noted in the objective of the two disclosures.

The topic covers fundamental rights that are classified as sub-sub-topics in ESRS S1 and ESRS S2 which
are interconnected. Such connections are not explicit in the ESRS S1 standard and have been included
in the table below. In other words, when mapping the disclosures to report, the sub-sub-topics and/or
metrics related to fundamental rights should be considered for materiality assessment when the topic
Own Workforce is considered material (refer to the table below), as they cover different aspects of the
matter own workforce and as such, they all relate to own workforce as a topic.
In addition, the metrics on S1-6, S1-7 and S1-17 are mapped to the Own Workforce directly. In the case
of S1-6 and S1-7, these provide contextual information that supports the understanding of the
information reported in the other ESRS S1 disclosures and these form the basis for calculation of other
