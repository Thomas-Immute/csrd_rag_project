Fuel combustion is an additional critical source of air emissions. In this case an example of a\nformula may be the following, where FCn is the fuel n consumed within the source category (Gj);\nEFk is the emission factor for this pollutant k (g/Gj); and Emk are emissions of the specific pollutant\nk (g).\nE = FC * EF ;\nmk n k",
