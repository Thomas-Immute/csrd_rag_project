    "text": "These include enhancing biological anthropogenic sinks of CO2 and using chemical engineering to\nachieve long-term removal and storage. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from industrial and\nenergy-related sources, which alone does not remove CO2 from the atmosphere, can remove\natmospheric CO2 if combined with bioenergy production (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture &\nStorage â€“ BECCS). Removals can be subject to reversals, which are movements of stored GHG out",
