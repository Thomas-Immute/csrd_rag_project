    "text": "The oil and gas sector has a high proportion of male workers. The risk of sexual harassment at the\nworkplace is particularly high in ‘male dominated’ sectors and at remote locations.\nNegative publicity on this issue can have a negative impact on the reputation of specific undertakings\nas well as on the industry as a whole, and can make it more difficult to retain existing and recruit new\nfemale workers.",
