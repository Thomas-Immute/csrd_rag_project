Assuming now that that the employees of the reporting undertaking are 25 and that they use the\ncoworking space for 220 days a year, the yearly water withdrawal of the undertaking in the\ncoworking space would be the water withdrawal per employee multiplied for the number of its\nemployees and the days worked, therefore 54Lx25x220 = 297000 L (corresponding to 297 m3).\n146.
